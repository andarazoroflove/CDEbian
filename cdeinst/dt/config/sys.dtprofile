# #  Your $HOME/.dtprofile is read each time you login to the Common Desktop
# #  Environment (CDE) and is the place to set or override desktop 
# #  environment variables for your session. Environment variables set in
# #  $HOME/.dtprofile are made available to all applications on the desktop.
# #  The desktop will accept either sh or ksh syntax for the commands in 
# #  $HOME/.dtprofile.

# #  Random stdout and stderr output from apps started by Session Mgr or
# #  by actions via front panel or workspace menu can be directed into 
# #  the user's $HOME/.dt/sessionlogs directory.  By default this output
# #  is not recorded.  Instead it is sent off to /dev/null (Unix's "nothing"
# #  device).
# #   
# #  If this random application output is wanted (usually only wanted for
# #  debugging purposes), commenting out following "dtstart_sessionlogfile"
# #  lines will send output to your $HOME/.dt/sessionlogs directory.
# #   
# #  Alternatively, can change "/dev/null" to "/dev/console" to see this
# #  debugging output on your console device.  Can start a console via the
# #  Workspace programs menu or via Application Mgr's Desktop Tools 
# #  "Terminal Console" icon.

# #  By default, the desktop does not read your standard $HOME/.profile
# #  or $HOME/.login files. This can be changed by uncommenting the
# #  DTSOURCEPROFILE variable assignment at the end of this file. The
# #  desktop reads .profile if your $SHELL is "sh" or "ksh", or .login
# #  if your $SHELL is "csh".
# #
# #  The desktop reads the .dtprofile and .profile/.login without an 
# #  associated terminal emulator such as xterm or dtterm. This means
# #  there is no available command line for interaction with the user.
# #  This being the case, these scripts must avoid using commands that
# #  depend on having an associated terminal emulator or that interact
# #  with the user. Any messages printed in these scripts will not be
# #  seen when you log in and any prompts such as by the 'read' command
# #  will return an empty string to the script. Commands that set a
# #  terminal state, such as "tset" or "stty" should be avoided.
# #
# #  With minor editing, it is possible to adapt your .profile or .login
# #  for use both with and without the desktop.  Group the statements not
# #  appropriate for your desktop session into one section and enclose them
# #  with an "if" statement that checks for the setting of the "DT"
# #  environment variable. When the desktop reads your .profile or .login
# #  file, it will set "DT" to a non-empty value for which your .profile or
# #  .login can test. 
# #   
# #  example for sh/ksh
# #  
# #    if [ ! "$DT" ]; then
# #      #
# #      # commands and environment variables not appropriate for desktop
# #      #
# #      stty ...
# #   tset ...
# #   DISPLAY=mydisplay:0
# #   ...
# #    fi

# #    #
# #    # environment variables common to both desktop and non-desktop
# #    #
# #    PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
# #    MYVAR=value
# #    export MYVAR
# #    ...
# #	  
# #  example for csh
# #
# #    if ( ! ${?DT} ) then
# #      #
# #      # commands and environment variables not appropriate for desktop
# #      #
# #      stty ...
# #      tset ...
# #      setenv DISPLAY mydisplay:0
# #      ...

# #    # environment variables common to both desktop and non-desktop

# #    ...
# #  
# #  Errors in .dtprofile or .profile (.login) may prevent a successful
# #  login.  The login process scans .dtprofile and .profile (.login)
# #  for errors (using the '-n' option to the shell).  It avoids running
# #  them if errors are found and prints the errors to the
# #  $HOME/.dt/startlog file.  However, his process is not fool proof
# #  as some shells are better at finding errors thant others.
# #  If after you login, your session startup terminates and you
# #  are presented with the login screen, this might be the cause. If this
# #  happens, select the Options->Sessions->Failsafe Session item on the
# #  login screen, login and correct the error. The $HOME/.dt/startlog and
# #  $HOME/.dt/errorlog files may be helpful in identifying errors.
