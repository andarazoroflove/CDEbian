#   This file contains a list of host names which are allowed or
#   denied XDMCP connection access to this machine.  When a remote
#   display (typically an X-termimal) requests login service, Dtlogin
#   will consult this file to determine if service should be granted
#   or denied.
#
#   # Access control file for XDMCP connections
#
#   To control Direct and Broadcast access:
#
#       pattern
#
#   To control Indirect queries:
#
#       pattern         list of hostnames and/or macros ...
#
#   To use the chooser:
#
#       pattern         CHOOSER BROADCAST
#
#   or
#
#       pattern         CHOOSER list of hostnames and/or macros ...
#
#   To define macros:
#
#       %name           list of hosts ...
#
#
#   The first form tells dtlogin which displays to respond to itself.
#   The second form tells dtlogin to forward indirect queries from hosts
#     matching the specified pattern to the indicated list of hosts.
#   The third form tells dtlogin to handle indirect queries using the
#     chooser; the chooser is directed to send its own queries out via the
#     broadcast address and display the results on the terminal.
#   The fourth form is similar to the third, except instead of using the
#     broadcast address, it sends DirectQuerys to each of the hosts in
#     the list
#
#   In all cases, dtlogin uses the first entry which matches the terminal;
#   for IndirectQuery messages only entries with right hand sides can
#   match, for Direct and Broadcast Query messages, only entries without
#   right hand sides can match.
#
#   Information regarding the format of entries in this file is
#   included at the end of the file.

*			# grant service to all remote displays

#
# The nicest way to run the chooser is to just ask it to broadcast
# requests to the network - that way new hosts show up automatically.
# Sometimes, however, the chooser can't figure out how to broadcast,
# so this may not work in all environments.
#

*               CHOOSER BROADCAST       # any indirect host can get a chooser

#
# If you'd prefer to configure the set of hosts each terminal sees,
# then just uncomment these lines (and comment the CHOOSER line above)
# and edit the %hostlist line as appropriate
#

# %hostlist      host-a host-b

# *              CHOOSER %hostlist       #

#			   ENTRY FORMAT
#
#   An entry in this file is either a host name or a pattern.  A
#   pattern may contain one or more meta characters (`*' matches any
#   sequence of 0 or more characters, and `?'  matches any single
#   character) which are compared against the host name of the remote
#   device requesting service.
#
#   If the entry is a host name, all comparisons are done using
#   network addresses, so any name which converts to the correct
#   network address may be used.  For patterns, only canonical host
#   names are used in the comparison, so do not attempt to match
#   aliases.
#
#   Preceding either a host name or a pattern with a `!'  character
#   causes hosts which match that entry to be excluded.
#
#   When checking access for a particular display host, each entry is
#   scanned in turn and the first matching entry determines the
#   response.
#
#   Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment delimiter
#   causing the rest of that line to be ignored,
#
#   ex.
#	!xtra.lcs.mit.edu  # disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
#	bambi.ogi.edu      # allow access from this particular display
#	*.lcs.mit.edu      # allow access from any display in LCS
