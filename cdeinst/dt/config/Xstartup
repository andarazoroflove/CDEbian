#  This file is typically a shell script. It is run as "root" and should be
#  very careful about security. This is the place to put commands that
#  display the message of the day or do other system-level functions on
#  behalf of the user. The following are the environment variables set for 
#  use in the script:
#
#    DISPLAY, HOME, PATH, USER, SHELL, TZ (timeZone)
#
#  System Administrators are encouraged to use this file as a base to run 
#  system-wide initialization commands with good security.
