The Template Application
------------------------
This is a template Dt application. It illustrates how to write
a simple application integrated with the Dt desktop.

The application provides a simple airbrush drawing facility using
Motif. It defines a new file type '*.template' which contains a list
of x, y coordinates for the drawn points. The application and data
format favor simplicity over performance, and could obviously
be improved.

Actions
-------
A set of actions are provided to allow integration into the Dt desktop:

	TemplateNew (labeled New) - to create a new Template data file.
	TemplateOpen (labeled Open) - to open an existing Template data file.
	TemplatePrint (labeled Print) - to Print a Template data file.

Datatypes
---------
The template data file is described by the datatype TemplateData, defined
in C/template.dt

Icons
-----
A minimal set of icons are provided to integrate with the Dt desktop. The
application group icons, window manager icon, Action icons and data file
icons are identical. In a more sophisticated application, these would
most likely be similar, but visually differentiated in some way.

Help
----
A simple help file is provided. This can be displayed from within the
application using the Help viewer widget (by selecting 'Overview' in the
'Help' menu. It can also be view using the dthelpview tool.

Message Catalog
---------------
All user-visible text in the application is loaded from the message catalog
template.cat.

Example file
------------
As recommended in the Programmer's Guide, an example.template file is
provided.

App-defaults file
-----------------
The app-defaults file 'Template' contains resources to set the initial
size of the application window.

The Application Package
-----------------------
The Makefile provided will build the application binary ("templatebin") and
associated files. It then copies these into the newly created application
package directory hierarchy ("template"). The ./dt/ subdirectory hierarchy
is a Dt standard and is described in the Programmer's Guide. The other
directories (bin, app-defaults, msg) are not standard directories and may
vary for your application and installation script.

The binary templatebin will function on its own, however to fully install
the application and integrate with the Dt desktop you will need to write a
platform-specific installation script.  The installation script will
typically need to be run with root privileges.

This script should be written to ensure that the binary, app-defaults and
message catalog get installed correctly on your target system, and are
available in the appropriate user or system search paths.

This script should also install the ToolTalk ptype into the system by
running the command 'tt_type_comp -d system template.ptype'.

    NOTE: There is a bug in the system that may prevent tt_type_comp from
    notifying an existing desktop session that new types have been added.
    The symptom of this bug will be that the application will fail with the
    following error message:

	templatebin: ttmedia_ptype_declare failed

    If this occurs, a workaround is to send SIGUSR2 to the running ttsession
    process, like so:

	$ /usr/bin/ps -e | grep ttsess
	  7850 console  0:08 ttsessio
	$ kill -USR2 7850

    This will cause ttsession to reread its types files.  See ttsession(1)
    for further information.  An alternative workaround is to logout from
    the desktop and restart.
If you choose to test the templatebin binary before integrating it with
the Dt desktop, you will need to set the following (this assumes you
have built out of /usr/dt/examples/template):

  export XMICONBMSEARCHPATH=$XMICONBMSEARCHPATH:/usr/dt/examples/template/template/dt/appconfig/icons/C/%B:

  export XMICONSEARCHPATH=$XMICONSEARCHPATH:/usr/dt/examples/template/template/dt/appconfig/icons/C/%B:

  export DTHELPSEARCHPATH=$DTHELPSEARCHPATH:/usr/dt/examples/template/template/dt/appconfig/help/C/%H.sdl:

The installation script should be written to ensure that the bin, app-defaults
and message catalog get installed correctly on your target system, and

The final step of the installation script should be to execute
'dtappintegrate -s template'.  This will ensure that the desktop
files under the ./dt/ subdirectory are installed correctly and
inserted into the appropriate Dt system and user paths.

Localization
------------
The application is ready for localization. This directory contains
the non-localizable portions of the application.

The ./C/ directory contains the localizable portions of the application
in US English. Some or all of these files should be translated and
placed in a separate locale-specific directory.
