.TH "Edit" "special file"
.SH "NAME"
\fBEdit\fP \(em compose or edit a document
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.nf
[\fIfile\fP] Edit([out|inout] \fImediaType contents\fP
        [in title \fIdocName\fP]);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBEdit\fP request causes the handler to edit a document
and reply with the new contents when the editing is completed\&.
.PP
It is up to the handler to decide issues such as:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
When the editing operation can be deemed completed
.IP "   \(bu" 6
What user gesture signals the completion of the editing
.IP "   \(bu" 6
What the handling tool should do with itself after replying
.PP
If the handling tool supports some form of intermediate save operation
during editing,
it must send a
\fBDeposit\fP request back to the tool that requested the
\fBEdit\fP\&.
.PP
The
\fIcontents\fP argument
is the contents of the document\&.
If this argument is unset
(in other words, has a value of
\fB(char *)0\fP), then the contents of the document are in
the file named in the message\&'s
\fIfile\fP attribute\&.
The data type
(\fImediaType\fP) of the
\fIcontents\fP argument should be
\fBstring\fP, unless nulls are valid in the given media type,
in which case the data type must be
\fBbytes\fP\&.
.PP
If the
\fIcontents\fP argument is of mode
\fBout\fP, then a new document must be composed
and its contents returned in this argument\&.
.PP
The
\fIdocName\fP argument contains the name of the document\&.
If the
\fIdocName\fP argument is absent and the
\fIfile\fP attribute is set,
the file name is considered to be the title of the document\&.
This string would be suitable for display in a window title bar, for example\&.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.PP
The
\fBttmedia_ptype_declare\fP(3) function can be used to register for,
and help process, this message\&.
.PP
This message can be sent with the
\fBttmedia_load\fP(3) function\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To edit an X11 XBM bitmap, the application can send an
\fBEdit\fP request with a first argument whose vtype is
\fBXBM\fP, and whose value is a string such as:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW#define foo_width 44\en#define foo_height 94\en\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
The
\fB\en\fP in the example represents the newline character\&.
The notation is the same as in the ISO\ C standard\&.
.PP
To edit an X11 XBM bitmap contained in a file, the application can send an
\fBEdit\fP request naming that file in its
\fIfile\fP attribute,
with a first argument whose vtype is
\fBXBM\fP, and whose value is not set\&.
.SH "ERRORS"
.PP
The ToolTalk service may return one of the following errors
in processing the
\fBEdit\fP request:
.IP "TT_DESKTOP_ECANCELED" 10
The user overrode the
\fBEdit\fP request\&.
When an
\fBEdit\fP request is failed with
\fBTT_DESKTOP_ECANCELED\fP, the document should not be updated
as a result, but rather should remain as it was before
the failure reply was received\&.
.IP "TT_DESKTOP_ENOENT" 10
The file that was alleged to contain the document does not exist\&.
.IP "TT_DESKTOP_ENODATA" 10
The in-mode
\fIcontents\fP argument had no value and the
\fIfile\fP attribute
of the message was not set\&.
.IP "TT_MEDIA_ERR_FORMAT" 10
The document is not a valid instance of the media type\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBttmedia_ptype_declare\fP(3), \fBttmedia_load\fP(3); \fIIntro\fP, \fBDisplay\fP requests\&.
