.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The XCDE data types database provides definitions for the data types
and actions recognized by XCDE clients\&.
.PP
The general syntax of the data types files is as described above in
the SYNOPSIS section of this man page\&. The set of general constructs composing
the database entries is as follows:
.SS "Comments"
.PP
Any line whose first non-space character is # is treated as a comment
line, and is ignored during the reading of the database file\&.
.SS "Database Version"
.PP
The database loader supports a version number, which indicates the version
of the database syntax used by a particular database file\&. If a database version
number is not specified, then the database loader assumes that the file uses
the version 1\&.0 syntax, described here\&. If a database file specifies a version
number, then it must be the first non-blank, non-comment line in the database
file; if the version is specified anywhere else in the file, then an error
message is generated, and the remainder of that database file is ignored\&.
The database version number is specified using the following syntax:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWset DtDbVersion=\fIversion_number\fP\fR
.fi
.PP
.SS "String Variables"
.PP
Database records can reference string variables that are set within
the database file\&. The scope of a string variable is restricted to only those
record definitions within the database file defining the string variable\&.
A string variable is defined using the following syntax:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWset \fIVariableName\fP=\fIvariable_value\fP\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
String variables are referenced using either of the standard shell variable
referencing syntaxes: $\fIvariable_name\fP or ${ \fIvariable_name\fP}\&. A variable name can be made up of any of the alphanumeric
characters and the underscore\&.
.SS "Environment Variables"
.PP
Database records may refer to environment variables, using either of
the standard shell variable referencing syntaxes: $\fIenvironment_variable\fP or ${\fIenvironment_variable\fP}\&. If the environment
variable name conflicts with a string variable name, the string variable takes
precedence\&.
.SS "Line Continuation"
.PP
Any field within a record can be continued onto another line by ending
the line with a \ character\&. The \ and any \fB<blank>\fPs following
the \ and preceding the newline are discarded; leading \fB<blank>\fPs
on the following line are preserved in the continued field\&.
.SS "Record Name"
.PP
The first line of a record is made up of the record type, \fIRecordType\fP (one of: \fBDATA_ATTRIBUTES\fP, \fBDATA_CRITERIA\fP or \fBACTION\fP), followed by the record name, \fIrecord_name\fP, which is henceforth used to identify this record\&.
The \fIrecord_name\fP string must be coded in ASCII and must
be uniquely named across the data attributes, data criteria and actions tables\&.
.SS "Record Delimiters"
.PP
After the record name has been located, the set of corresponding fields
is delimited by the { and } characters\&. Each of these characters must appear
on a line by itself\&.
.SS "Fields"
.PP
The fields are all of the non-comment lines found between the record
delimiters\&. They are composed of keyword/value pairs\&. The \fIFieldName\fP string must be coded in ASCII\&. The \fIfield_value\fP
may be coded in additional, implementation-dependent, code sets, except that
any literal string values shown in Data Criteria Format, below, string must
be coded in ASCII\&.
.SS "Record Types"
.PP
There are three recognized record types in database files used for data
types (and actions):
.IP "   \(bu" 6
\fBDATA_CRITERIA\fP
.IP "   \(bu" 6
\fBDATA_ATTRIBUTES\fP
.IP "   \(bu" 6
\fBACTION\fP
.PP
These three kinds of database record can appear together in the same
file or they can be segregated into separate files\&. See \fBdtaction\fP(1) for the file format of \fBACTION\fP
records\&.
.SH "DATA_CRITERIA RECORDS"
.PP
The first seven subsections of this section describe the \fIFieldName\fP \fIs\fP supported for data
criteria records\&. The remaining subsections describe formatting and sorting
information for data criteria records\&.
.SS "NAME_PATTERN Field"
.PP
A shell pattern-matching expression describing the file names that could
match this data\&. See Pattern Matching Notation\&. The default is an empty string,
which means to ignore file patterns in matching\&.
.PP
If the data to be matched is in a buffer, rather than a file, the \fBNAME_PATTERN\fP expression is evaluated against
the \fIopt_name\fP value given to \fBDtDtsBufferToDataType\fP(3) and related functions\&.
.SS "PATH_PATTERN Field"
.PP
A shell pattern-matching expression describing the absolute pathnames
that could match this data\&. See Pattern Matching Notation\&. The default is
an empty string, which means to ignore path patterns in matching\&.
.PP
The \fBPATH_PATTERN\fP expression
is used only for matching data in files; it does not affect matching of data
in buffers\&.
.SS "CONTENT Field"
.PP
Strings that match on the contents of a file, buffer or directory:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\fIoffset type value(s)\fP\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
The \fIoffset\fP string is a positive decimal
integer number of octets from the beginning of the file or buffer, where the
first \fIvalue\fP is tested\&. The \fIoffset\fP value is ignored for the \fBfilename\fP \fItype\fP\&.
.PP
The \fItype\fP string is one of the following:
.IP "\fBstring\fP" 10
The \fIvalue\fP is a single string that is
compared against the data starting at the \fIoffset\fP
location\&.
.IP "\fBbyte\fP" 10
.IP "\fBshort\fR" 10
.IP "\fBlong\fR" 10
Each \fB<blank>\fP-separated \fIvalue\fP
is an unsigned integer: decimal, octal (leading \fB0\fP)
or hexadecimal (leading \fB0x\fP or \fB0X\fP)\&. Multiple
values are matched against multiple byte (octet), short (two octets) or long
(four octets) locations starting at \fIoffset\fP
octets from the beginning of the file or data\&.
.IP "\fBfilename\fP" 10
The \fIvalue\fP is a string that is compared
against the filenames located anywhere in a directory\&. The use of \fBfilename\fP on non-directory data produces undefined results\&.
.PP
The default \fBCONTENT\fP is an
empty field, which means to ignore contents in matching\&.
.PP
The \fBCONTENT\fP field applies
to data in both files and buffers\&.
.PP
Examples of two data criteria records with \fBCONTENT\fP fields are:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWDATA_CRITERIA PCL1
{
        DATA_ATTRIBUTES_NAME    PCL
        CONTENT         0 byte 033 0105
        MODE            f&!x
}
DATA_CRITERIA POSTSCRIPT3
{
        DATA_ATTRIBUTES_NAME    POSTSCRIPT
        CONTENT         0 string %!
        MODE            f&!x
}\fR
.fi
.PP
.SS "MODE Field"
.PP
A string of zero to four characters that match the mode field of a \fIstat\fP structure (see \fBstat\fP(2))\&. The first character
indicates:
.IP "\fBd\fP" 10
match a directory
.IP "\fBs\fP" 10
match a socket
.IP "\fBl\fP" 10
match a symbolic link
.IP "\fBf\fP" 10
match a regular file
.IP "\fBb\fP" 10
match a block file
.IP "\fBc\fP" 10
match a character special file
.PP
The first, or subsequent characters, can also be:
.IP "\fBr\fP" 10
match any file with any of its user, group, or other read permission
bits set
.IP "\fBw\fP" 10
match any file with any of its user, group, or other write permission
bits set
.IP "\fBx\fP" 10
match any file with any of its user, group, or other execute or directory-search
permission bits set
.PP
For example, the \fBMODE\fP field
of \fBfrw\fP matches any regular file that is readable or writable; \fBx\fP matches any file with any of its executable or search bits set\&.
.PP
The default is an empty field, which means to ignore the mode in matching\&.
.PP
If the data to be matched is in a buffer, rather than a file, the buffer
is processed as if it had a mode of \fBfr\fP\&.
.SS "LINK_NAME Field"
.PP
A shell pattern-matching expression describing the filename component
(basename) of the filename the symbolic link points to that could match this
data\&. See Pattern Matching Notation\&. The default is an empty expression, which
means to ignore symbolic link names in matching\&. \fBLINK_NAME\fP points to the file itself, not to the name of the file\&.
.PP
The \fBLINK_NAME\fP expression is
used only for matching data in files; it does not affect matching of data
in buffers\&.
.SS "LINK_PATH Field"
.PP
A shell pattern-matching expression describing the absolute pathname
of the file pointed to by the symbolic link that could match this data\&. See
Pattern Matching Notation\&. The default is an empty expression, which means
to ignore symbolic link name in matching\&.
.PP
The \fBLINK_PATH\fP expression is
used only for matching data in files; it does not affect matching of data
in buffers\&.
.SS "DATA_ATTRIBUTES_NAME Field"
.PP
The name of this type of data\&. This value is a \fIrecord_name\fP in the data attributes table\&.
.SS "Pattern Matching Notation"
.PP
The pattern-matching text field permits use of the shell pattern-matching
characters *, ?, and [\!]\&. The asterisk (*) matches any set of characters,
the question mark (?) matches a single character, and the square brackets
([\!]) match any one of a set of characters enclosed in the square brackets\&.
The full definition of shell pattern matching is in the X/Open \fBCAE
Specification, Commands and Utilities, Issue 4\fP\&.
.SS "Logical Expressions"
.PP
The logical operators AND (&), OR (\!|\!) and NOT (!)
can be used in any of the data criteria fields, except for \fBDATA_ATTRIBUTES_NAME\fP, as shown in Data Criteria Format, below\&.
The resultant expressions are evaluated from left to right\&.
.SS "White Space"
.PP
White space is used to delimit tokens, as shown by the \fIblanks\fP and \fInewline\fP terminals in Data
Criteria Format, below\&. Within the \fIpattern\fP
terminal, however, leading and trailing white space not explicitly shown in
the grammar is significant to the expression\&. For example,
.PP
.nf
\f(CWNAME_PATTERN   abc | def\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
is matched by either `` \fBabc\0\fP\&'\&' (with a trailing \fB<space>\fP) or ``\0 \fBdef\fP\&'\&' (with a leading \fB<space>\fP)\&.
.SS "Escape Character"
.PP
Shell pattern-matching and logical expression characters can be escaped
and used as literal characters by preceding the character with a backslash
(\)\&. For example, \* is interpreted as an asterisk, \? as a question mark
and \[\] as square brackets\&. Backslash itself can be escaped by preceding
it with a backslash (\\)\&.
.SS "Data Criteria Format"
.PP
The following pseudo-BNF describes the data criteria variable definition:
.TS

.SS "Data Criteria Sorting"
.PP
There may be multiple data criteria records that could match a file
or data\&. This subsection describes the sorting process used by the XCDE
data typing services\&. The more specific criteria are sorted toward the top
of the list and the more general criteria toward the bottom\&. The data criteria
record selected is the first match found on the resulting sorted list\&.
.PP
The following sorting rules are applied in sequence to each possible
pair of data criteria records\&. If a rule determines that one data criteria
record is more specific than another, the two records are positioned in the
list so that the more specific comes before the less specific; otherwise,
the next rule in sequence is applied\&.
.IP "   1." 6
Records are ordered by the fields specified within them:
.RS
.IP "   1." 6
Records with both content and pattern fields (most specific)
.IP "   2." 6
Records with only pattern fields
.IP "   3." 6
Records with only content fields
.IP "   4." 6
Records with neither content nor pattern fields (least specific)
.RE
.IP "   6." 6
Records are ordered based on the presence of any shell pattern-matching
characters in their file name patterns (NAME_PATTERN or PATH_PATTERN):
.RS
.IP "   6." 6
File names with no shell pattern-matching characters (most specific)
.IP "   7." 6
File names with no shell pattern-matching characters in the final suffix
(such as \fB*\&.c\fP)
.IP "   8." 6
Others (least specific)
.RE
.IP "   10." 6
Records with a path pattern are more specific than records with a name
pattern\&.
.IP "   11." 6
Records with a name pattern of \fB*\fP are treated as if
they have no name pattern\&.
.IP "   12." 6
Records are ordered based on the types of shell pattern-matching characters
in their patterns:
.RS
.IP "   12." 6
Patterns with any \fB?\fP (most specific)
.IP "   13." 6
Patterns with any \fB[\!]\fP
.IP "   14." 6
Patterns with any \fB*\fP (least specific)
.RE
.IP "   16." 6
Records with path patterns that share leading pathname components are
ordered as follows:
.RS
.IP "   16." 6
The leading pathname components without shell pattern-matching characters
are selected for comparison\&. (For example, \fB/foo/bar/bam/baz\&.?\fP
and \fB/foo/bar/*/baz\fP are evaluated as \fB/foo/bar/bam\fP and \fB/foo/bar\fP for this rule\&.)
.IP "   17." 6
The selected paths are ordered so that the longest is more specific\&.
.IP "   18." 6
If the selected paths are equal, the full path patterns are ordered
based on the number and types of shell pattern-matching characters in their
patterns, in the following sequence:
.RS
.IP "   18." 6
Path patterns with fewer \fB*\fP characters are more specific\&.
.IP "   19." 6
Path patterns with fewer \fB[\!]\fP characters are
more specific\&.
.IP "   20." 6
Path patterns with fewer \fB?\fP characters are more specific\&.
.RE
.IP "   22." 6
If the path patterns are still of equal specificity, the one with the
larger number of literal characters (those not used as shell pattern-matching
special characters) in its pattern after the first non-literal character is
more specific\&.
.RE
.IP "   24." 6
Records are ordered based on a character sorting of the path patterns,
with the lowest value in collation sequence being more specific\&.
.IP "   25." 6
Records are ordered so that the one with more criteria is more specific\&.
(For example, a record with a \fBPATH_PATTERN\fP, \fBCONTENT\fP and \fBMODE\fP is more specific than one with only a \fBPATH_PATTERN\fP\&.)
.PP
Two records still equal after executing the preceding rules are ordered
in an unspecified sequence\&.
.SH "DATA_ATTRIBUTES RECORDS"
.PP
The following \fIFieldName\fPs are supported for data
attribute records\&. Each of the \fIFieldName\fPs is identical
to the corresponding \fIname\fP member string of
a \fBDtDtsAttribute\fR structure; see \fBDt/Dts\&.h\fP\&.
.SS "DESCRIPTION Field"
.PP
A textual description of the data that is suitable for presentation
to a user requesting information about the data\&. The description should contain
no formatting information such as tab or newline characters\&. The application
that presents the information to the user formats the information\&. If this
field is \fBNULL\fP or is not included
in the data attribute record, the name of the data attribute should be used\&.
.SS "ICON Field"
.PP
The name of the icon to use for this data\&. If this field is \fBNULL\fP or is not included in the data attribute
record, a default value ( \fBDtactn\fP for an executable file
or \fBDtdata\fP for other data) should be used\&.
.PP
Icons are found by using the standard XCDE icon search path, so
the value can be either an absolute pathname (for example, \fB/foo/icons/myicon\&.bm\fP), a relative pathname (for example, \fBicons/myicon\&.bm\fP)
or a partial filename (for example, \fBmyicon\fP)\&. Partial filenames
are preferred because they allow the XCDE icon search path to find the
icon with the optimum size and depth for the current environment\&.
.SS "INSTANCE_ICON Field"
.PP
The name of the icon to use for this instance of data\&. The contents
of this field are as described in ICON Field, above\&. If \fBINSTANCE_ICON\fP is set, the application should use it instead of \fBICON\fP\&. If this field is \fBNULL\fP or is not included in the data attribute record, the \fBICON\fP field should be used\&.
.PP
An example value of \fBINSTANCE_ICON\fP
is \fB%name%\&.icon\fP, which would select an icon based on a specific
filename, rather than on a generic data type\&.
.SS "PROPERTIES Field"
.PP
Keywords to indicate properties for this data\&. Valid values are \fBvisible\fP and \fBinvisible\fP\&. These provide guidance
to an application such as a file manager about whether a file should be visibly
displayed to the user\&.
.PP
If this field is \fBNULL\fP or is
not included in the data attribute record, the visible property should be
assumed\&.
.SS "ACTIONS Field"
.PP
A comma-separated list of actions that can be performed on this data\&.
This list refers to names in the action table for actions that can be performed
on this data\&. If this field is \fBNULL\fP
or is not included in the data attribute record, no action is available\&.
.SS "NAME_TEMPLATE Field"
.PP
A string used to create a new file for data of this type\&. The string
is intended to be passed to \fBsprintf\fP(3) with the file name
as the single argument\&. For example: \fB%s\&.mif\fP\&. The default
is empty\&. (This field is contrasted with the NAME_PATTERN field of the data
criteria table in that the template is used to create a specific file, such
as \fB%s\&.c\fP, whereas the pattern is used to find files, such
as \fB*\&.c\fP)\&.
.SS "IS_EXECUTABLE Field"
.PP
A string-Boolean value that tells users of this data type that it can
be executed as an application\&. If \fBIS_EXECUTABLE\fP is a true value (as determined by the \fBDtDtsIsTrue\fP function), the data is executable; if this field is \fBNULL\fP, is not included in the data attribute
record or is not true, then the data is considered not executable\&.
.SS "MOVE_TO_ACTION Field"
.PP
The name of an action to be invoked when an object is moved to the current
object using a drag and drop operation\&.
.PP
The \fBMOVE_TO_ACTION\fP, \fBCOPY_TO_ACTION\fP and \fBLINK_TO_ACTION\fP fields cause an action to be invoked with the
drop target as the first of the \fBDtActionArg\fR
arguments to the \fBDtActionInvoke\fP function, and the drag
sources as the remaining \fBDtActionArg\fR
arguments\&. However, if the drop target is an action itself, it is omitted
from the \fBDtActionArg\fR list\&. For example,
using the syntax of the \fBdtaction\fP utility, if objects A
and B are dropped onto non-action object C:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWdtaction \fIaction-name\fP C A B\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
If C is an action:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWdtaction \fIaction-name\fP A B\fR
.fi
.PP
.SS "COPY_TO_ACTION Field"
.PP
The name of an action to be invoked when an object is copied to the
current object using a drag and drop operation\&.
.SS "LINK_TO_ACTION Field"
.PP
The name of an action to be invoked when an object is linked to the
current object using a drag and drop operation\&.
.SS "IS_TEXT Field"
.PP
A string-Boolean value that tells users of this data type that it is
suitable for manipulation (viewing or editing) in a text editor or text widget\&.
The \fBIS_TEXT\fP field should be set
to a true value (as determined by the \fBDtDtsIsTrue\fP function)
if the data is textual in nature and if it should be presented to the user
in textual form\&. Criteria for making this determination include whether the
data:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
consists of human language, or
.IP "   \(bu" 6
is generated and maintained manually, or
.IP "   \(bu" 6
is usefully viewable and editable in a text editor,
or
.IP "   \(bu" 6
contains no (or only minimal) structuring and formatting
information\&.
.PP
If the \fBIS_TEXT\fP field is a
true value, this indicates that the data is eligible to be displayed directly
by an application\&. That is, the application can load the data directly into
a text editing widget (for example, XmText) instead of invoking an action
on the data\&. An example of this occurs in the XCDE mail services: if the
first part of a multipart message has \fBIS_TEXT\fP true, then it is displayed in the text area of the message view
window\&. Otherwise, the text area will contain only message headers and the
first part of the message will be displayed as an icon in the attachment pane\&.
It is immaterial whether the data \fIcan\fP be loaded into
an XmText widget\(emeven binary data can be\(embut rather whether the
data \fIshould\fP be loaded into an XmText widget\&.
.PP
Note that the \fBIS_TEXT\fP field
differs from the \fBtext\fP attribute of the \fBMIME_TYPE\fP field, which is the MIME content-type, as described
in RFC 1341\&. The MIME content-type determines whether the data consists of
textual characters or byte values\&. If the data consists of textual characters
and is labelled as \fBtext/*\fP, the \fBIS_TEXT\fP field determines whether it is appropriate for the data
to be presented to users in textual form\&.
.PP
Examples of common data types include recommendations of the appropriate
value of \fBIS_TEXT\fP:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Human language encoded in ASCII:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWMIME_TYPE text/plain
IS_TEXT true\fR
.fi
.PP
.IP "" 10
Note, however, that not everything that is ASCII should be presented
directly to the user\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Human language encoded in EUC, JIS, Unicode, or
an ISO Latin charset:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWMIME_TYPE text/plain; charset=XXX
IS_TEXT true\fR
.fi
.PP
.IP "   \(bu" 6
CalendarAppointmentAttrs:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWMIME_TYPE text/plain
IS_TEXT false\fR
.fi
.PP
.IP "" 10
Calendar appointments should be treated as opaque objects (editable
only by the appointment editor) and not shown to the user as text\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6

.SS "MEDIA Field"
.PP
The names in the \fBMEDIA\fP name
space describe the form of the data itself\&. \fBMEDIA\fP names are used as ICCCM selection targets; they are named
in the \fBMEDIA\fP field of data type
records; and they are used in the \fItype\fP parameter
of ToolTalk Media Exchange messages\&.
.PP
The \fBMEDIA\fP name space is a
subset of the name space of selection target atoms as defined by the ICCCM\&.
All selection targets that specify a data format are valid \fBMEDIA\fP names, and all valid \fBMEDIA\fP names can be used directly as selection targets\&. Some selection
targets specify an attribute of the selection (for example, LIST_LENGTH) or
a side effect to occur (for example, DELETE), rather than a data format\&. These
attribute selection targets are not part of the \fBMEDIA\fP name space\&.
.SS "MIME_TYPE Field"
.PP
\fBMEDIA\fP is the XCDE internal,
unique name for data types\&. However, other external naming authorities have
also established name spaces\&. \fBMIME\fP
(Multipurpose Internet Message Extensions), as described in the referenced
MIME RFCs, is one of those external registries, and is the standard type name
space for the XCDE mail system\&.
.SS "X400_TYPE Field"
.PP
X\&.400 types are similar in structure to the \fBMEDIA\fP type, but are formatted using different rules and have
different naming authorities\&.
.SS "DATA_HOST Attribute"
.PP
The \fBDATA_HOST\fP attribute is
not a field that can be added to the data attributes table when it is in a
file, but it may be returned to an application reading attributes from the
table\&. The data typing service adds this attribute automatically to indicate
the host system from which the data type was loaded\&. If this field is \fBNULL\fP or is not included in the data attribute
record, the data type was loaded from the local system\&.
.SS "Modifiers"
.PP
The following modifiers can be used in the values of the data attributes
to modify the runtime values:
.IP "\fB%file%\fP" 10
The full pathname of the file\&.
.IP "\fB%dir%\fP" 10
The directory component of the pathname\&. For example, for \fB/usr/src/file\&.c\fP, \fB%dir%\fP
is \fB/usr/src\fP\&.
.IP "\fB%name%\fP" 10
The filename of the file\&. For example, for \fB/usr/src/file\&.c\fP, \fB%name%\fP is \fBfile\&.c\fP\&.
.IP "\fB%suffix%\fP" 10
The suffix of the file\&. For example, for \fB/usr/src/file\&.c\fP, \fB%suffix%\fP is \fBc\fP\&.
.IP "\fB%base%\fP" 10
The basename of the file\&. For example, for \fB/usr/src/file\&.c\fP, \fB%base%\fP is \fBfile\fP\&.
.PP
Strings enclosed in backquotes (`) are processed with the \fBpopen\fP function and the output replaces the backquotes and string\&.
.SS "Data Attributes Format"
