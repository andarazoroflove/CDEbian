\fBdtspcdenv\fP \(em environment Variable File for the CDE Subprocess Control Service
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The CDE Subprocess Control service provides the
ability for a process running on one system to
invoke another process on a different system\&.
By default, the environment variables of the
parent process are passed unmodified to the
child process (on the remote host);
however, there are some environment
variables that are given special handling\&.
In
addition, the user or system administrator can
specify environment variables that should be
modified when they are passed to the child process\&.
.PP
The system-wide environment files are:
\fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP and
\fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP
and the user-specific environment file is:
\fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP\&.
The file
\fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP is created
when CDE is installed\&.
This file may be overwritten
by subsequent CDE installations\&.
Consequently, local
variable definitions should be placed in the file
\fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP because this file is not
overwritten during installation\&.
.PP
The environment variable files are evaluated in the following order:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWlocal host: \fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP
local host: \fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP
local host: \fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP
remote host: \fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP
remote host: \fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP
remote host: \fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
The precedence occurs in the reverse order of
evaluation\&.
Thus, variables in the remote
host\&'s
\fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP file have the highest
precedence and variables in the local host\&'s
\fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP file have the lowest
precedence\&.
In this context, the local host is the
host where a CDE client is running and
the remote host is the host where a remote
process will be started (on behalf of
the local client)\&.
.PP
Lines beginning with a numer symbol (#) are considered
comments and are not processed\&.
.PP
The syntax for a non-commented line is:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWVAR_NAME=some_value\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
where
\fIVAR_NAME\fP is the name of an
environment variable and
\fIsome_value\fP is the value assigned to the variable\&.
.PP
If
\fIsome_value\fP contains a variable reference,
the reference will be replaced by the variable\&'s
value\&.
For example, if a CDE client has the
following definition in its environment:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWPATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
and the following definition occurs in one of the
environment files:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWPATH=/opt/foo/bin:$PATH\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
then before the remote process is executed,
\fBPATH\fP
will be expanded to:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWPATH=/opt/foo/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
The environment variable names may consist of
letters, digits or underscores and may be
enclosed in curly braces\&.
The environment variable files may contain
"unset <variable_name>" commands to prevent
an environment variable from being propagated
to the remote process\&.
For example, the following line would
prevent the variable
\fILIB_PATH\fP from being
propagated to the remote process:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWunset LIB_PATH\fR
.fi
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The
\fBdtspcd\fP daemon treats the following variables specially:
.IP "\fBDISPLAY\fP" 10
If
\fBDISPLAY\fP is set to "unix:<n>", "local:<n>" or ":<n>"
(where <n> is the screen number), then before the
remote process is executed,
\fBDISPLAY\fP is changed to the name of the local host and
the screen number is preserved\&.
.IP "\fBHOME\fP" 10
Before the remote process is executed,
\fBHOME\fP is set
to the value of the user\&'s home directory in
the password file on the remote host\&.
.IP "\fBSHELL\fP" 10
If
\fBSHELL\fP is not in the parent processes environment,
\fBSHELL\fP is set to the value of the user\&'s shell in
the password file on the remote host\&.
.IP "\fBPWD\fP" 10
The variable
\fBPWD\fP is not propagated to
the remote host\&.
Note that the above variables will be
overridden by their corresponding definitions
in an environment file\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following definition sets the variable
\fIFOO_BIN_PATH\fP to the value
\fB/var/foo/bin\fP: \fBFOO_BIN_PATH=/var/foo/bin\fP
.SH "FILES"
.IP "\fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP" 10
System-wide, installed environment variable definitions
used when a process is executed
.IP "\fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP" 10
System-wide, locally defined environment variable definitions
used when a process is executed
.IP "\fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP" 10
User-specific environment variable definitions used
when a process is executed
.SH "SEE ALSO"
