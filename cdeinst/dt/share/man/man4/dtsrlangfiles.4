.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The parsing of text into words in a particular language often
requires comparison with lists of specific words in that language\&.
These lists are maintained on external language files which are used by
both the offline database build programs and the online search API\&.
Language files mandatory for a particular database must be located
in the same directory as the other database files\&.
.PP
The base file names of language files are used to identify
the language or database to which they apply\&.
The initialization functions look first for database specific
language files, using the 1- to 8- character database name
as the base file name\&. Secondly the functions look for
generic files by language base name\&. Required language files
are provided for supported languages with generic base names\&.
A developer may edit the generic language file and rename it
to apply to a particular database\&.
.PP
Different types of language files are distinguished by different
file name extensions\&.
.SS "Stop Lists (\&.stp)"
.PP
The file name extension <\&.stp> is used to identify stop lists\&.
Stop lists are used to prevent indexing frequently occurring
but semantically unimportant words in a language\&.
Examples include common prepositions, indefinite articles,
and nonlinguistic character strings\&.
Stop lists are mandatory for supported European languages\&.
If a database specific stop list file is not found,
the generic language file must be available in the same
directory as the other database files\&.
.PP
Database specific stop lists are optional for Japanese\&.
.SS "Include Lists (\&.inc)"
.PP
The file name extension <\&.inc> is used to identify include lists\&.
Words found in an include list file are forcibly indexed
even if they would otherwise be discarded\&. Include lists
take precedence over stop lists\&. Include list files
are always optional; no generic language defaults are provided\&.
.SS "Kanji Compounds List (\&.knj)"
.PP
The file name extension <\&.knj> is used to identify indexable
lists of compound kanji words (that is, substrings of kanji characters
that are indexed both as individual words of one character,
and as a compound word)\&. Currently they apply only to
databases for the specific Japanese Language
\fBDtSrLaJPN2\fP\&.
.PP
The kanji compounds file is optional\&. If no database
specific knj file is found, the Japanese language initialization
function will try to open the generic \fBjpn\&.knj\fP file\&.
If the generic file is also not found,
kanji compounding will not be performed\&.
.SS "Language Files Format"
.PP
Each line of a language file represents one word\&. The word must begin in
column one and ends at the first ASCII whitespace character or the ASCII
linefeed character (\fB\n\fP, 0x0A) that terminates the
line\&. Any other text on the line after the first word token is discarded
as a comment\&. Lines that begin with \&'#\&', \&'$\&', \&'*\&', or \&'!\&' in column one
are discarded in their entirety as comments\&. Blank lines (that is, hose
that contain only the terminating linefeed), are also discarded\&.
.PP
The word lists in language files are loaded into memory
at initialization and thereafter referenced internally\&.
The most efficient processing occurs when the files are
maintained in frequency order (that is, when the most frequently
occurring words in the language are the first words in the file)\&.
Alternatively, if the frequency of occurrence of the words
is not known, it is recommended that the word order
in the file be randomized\&.
.SS "English Suffixes File"
.PP
Stemming of English words is accomplished with the Paice stemming
algorithm\&. This heuristic algorithm removes common suffixes
in a recurrent manner, and conflates words into a representation
of their etymological root\&. The suffixes are maintained in
\fBeng\&.sfx\fP
and loaded into memory at initialization\&. The suffixes file
is mandatory for English language databases and is not editable;
a copy of it must be found in the same directory as every
English language database\&.
