dtsrocffile \(em Describes the format and syntax of DtSearch ocf files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
An ocf file is a user-generated file that identifies the databases to be
accessed and the execution options to be enabled by one instance of an
online DtSearch API search engine\&. Different ocf files typically apply
to different instances of the engine\&. The file is opened and read by
\fBDtSearchInit\fP and its valid contents apply
throughout an engine session\&. It may be reread during a session under
certain circumstances referred to as reinitialization, usually caused
either by recognizable changes in database files during the session or
by a change in the ocf file\&'s modification time stamp\&.
.PP
Errors in an ocf file are typically either syntax errors or errors in
databases referred to by the file\&. While the API expects the ocf file to
be correct, most errors are not fatal\&. They usually result in a warning
message and discard of the offending directive\&. But if no databases
survive the initialization process, \fBDtSearchInit\fP
will fail\&. For this reason, the only mandatory directive in an ocf file
is at least one valid \fBKEYTYPE\fP directive for at least
one valid and accessible database\&.
.PP
The default base file name for an ocf file is
\fBdtsearch\&.ocf\fP, although the alternative name
\fBaustext\&.ocf\fP is also a valid default\&. The file is
expected to be found in the directory specified by the\fBDTSROCFPATH\fP environment variable, in the
current working directory, or in the \fBHOME\fP directory, in that order\&. However
the complete path/file name may be fully respecified by an argument to
\fBDtSearchInit\fP\&.
.SS "General Format"
.PP
An ocf file can contain only ASCII characters\&.
.PP
Each line (character string terminated by an ASCII linefeed)
contains 1 or more \&'keywords\&', and optionally 1 or more \&'values\&',
all separated by token delimiter characters\&.
.PP
All token delimiters are equivalent and any combination of one or more
of them is acceptable for separating keywords and values\&.
Token delimiters are the ASCII space, tab, comma, or equal sign\&.
.PP
Keywords must begin in column 1, and the first character
must be alphanumeric\&.
.PP
Empty lines and lines that begin with \fB#\fP,
\fB$\fP, \fB*\fP, or \fB!\fP in
column one are discarded in their entirety as comments\&.
.PP
Any additional text beyond the last required value on a line
is ignored as comments\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CWkeyword [keyword] [\&.\&.\&.] [value] [\&.\&.\&.] [comments]\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
Keywords and/or values might be case sensitive, but usually are not\&.
The principal exceptions are database names, which are always
case sensitive, and file names and path names in operating systems
like UNIX where such things are normally case sensitive\&.
.PP
Where a boolean value is required, any of the following are
acceptable\&. Only enough of the first characters are parsed
to distinguish between alternatives (case-insensitive):
.TS
tab();
lw(1.12in) lw(2.49in).
(On)(Of)f
(T)rue(F)alse
(Y)es(N)o
(E)nabled(D)isabled
(1)(0)
.TE
.PP
A missing value is taken for the affirmative\&.
.PP
The initialization function may provide defaults for missing values\&.
Despite the defaults, an ocf file must be provided with at least the
\fBKEYTYPE(S)\fP correctly completed for each database to be
accessed by the engine\&.
.PP
If lines are duplicated or directives conflict, the last
specified value(s) will be used\&.
.SS "Keywords and Options"
.IP "KEYTYPES \fIdddd\fP = [\&'\fIc\fP\&'] \fIlabel\fP, [\&'\fIc\fP\&'] \fIlabel\fP, \&.\&.\&." 10
.IP "KEYTYPE \fIdddd\fP = [\&'\fIc\fP\&'] \fIlabel\fP [\fIcomments\fP]" 10
These are the only required lines in an \&.ocf file\&. They identify the
databases to be opened, the keytypes available in each opened database,
and the character that distinguishes that keytype in the record key\&.
.IP "" 10
Keytypes can be specified one at a time by several
\fBKEYTYPE\fP lines, which include a provision for
comments, or grouped together with one or more
\fBKEYTYPES\fP lines\&. Both \fBKEYTYPE\fP and
\fBKEYTYPES\fP specifications are additive; if some
keytypes have already been specified for a database, the new ones are
merely added to the previously defined ones\&.
.RS
.IP "\fIdddd\fP" 10
1- to 8-character dictionary name; case sensitive\&.
.IP "\&'\fIc\fP\&'" 10
The keytype character or \fIktchar\fP for a keytype; a
single, case sensitive, alphanumeric, ASCII character in single quotes\&.
It identifies the first character of the database record key
corresponding to the desired keytype\&.
.IP "" 10
The \fIktchar\fP value is optional; if a
\fIktchar\fP is not specified, the default is the first
character of the label parameter that immediately follows it (described
below)\&. If a user config file specifies a \fIktchar\fP,
whether in the \fIktchar\fP parameter or by default, that
cannot be matched to a site file specification, it is ignored\&. The
\fIktchar\fP is paired with the subsequent label string\&.
For example, if "\&.\&.\&.\&'r\&' Old_Records,\&.\&.\&." appears in the site ocf file, a
lowercase \&'r\&' will be the \fIktchar\fP for a record type
labeled in user interfaces as "Old Records"\&.
.IP "\fIlabel\fP" 10
A 1- to 13-character symbolic string identifying the keytype\&. No spaces
are allowed in the label string, but underscores will be replaced by
spaces in the name field of the \fBKEYTYPES\fP structure\&.
The string is used for record type labels in the user interface
application\&. If there is no preceding \fIktchar\fP
parameter, the first character of the label is the identifying prefix
character for the record type in record ids\&.
.IP "" 10
Technically, the \fIlabel\fP parameter is optional
following a \fIktchar\fP specification\&. If two adjacent
\fIktchar\fP values in single quotes are detected, a
generic label for the first one will be created which is derived from
the \fIktchar\fP value\&.
.RE
.IP "PATH \fIdddd\fP = \fIpath\fP" 10
This directive is optional\&.
.RS
.IP "\fIdddd\fP" 10
1- to 8-character dictionary name; case sensitive\&.
.IP "\fIpath\fP" 10
Where to find the associated database files\&.
If no path is provided for a database,
the engine assumes the current working directory\&.
.RE
.IP "LABEL \fIdddd\fP \fItext\fP\&.\&.\&." 10
This directive is optional\&. It assigns an arbitrary string to the
database name, which will be returned by DtSearchInit and DtSearchReinit
rather than the default 1 to 8 char database file name\&. It is typically
used to provide an appropriate symbolic label string for a database for
the user interface\&. Not otherwise used by the search engine\&.
.PP
.RS
\fBNote:  
.IP "" 10
ALL text on the line immediately after the database name,
except the terminating linefeed, is included in the label\&.
.RE
.RS
.IP "\fIdddd\fP" 10
1- to 8-character dictionary name; case sensitive\&.
.IP "\fItext\fP" 10
The string value stored is all the text
on the rest of the line after the database name\&.
.RE
.IP "WHITLIM = \fIn\fP" 10
This directive is optional\&. It changes the default value of the words
\fIhitlimit\fP variable in the engine\&. This
variable will cause a word/stem search to abort if the results list
grows to some ridiculously large value\&. For extremely large repositories
the default may be too small, and for many smaller repositories it may
be too large\&. The value of \fIn\fP should be be a
positive integer in the range of a signed long integer\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP "\fBDTSROCFPATH\fP" 10
Optional\&. Specifies a directory where the ocf file may be located\&.
.IP "\fBHOME\fP" 10
Specifies an alternative directory in which to look for the ocf file if
it is not found in \fBDTSROCFPATH\fP or the current working
directory\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
