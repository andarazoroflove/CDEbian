.SH "NAME"
\fBdtspcd\fP \(em CDE Subprocess Control Service
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBdtspcd\fP [-debug]  [-log]  [-auth_dir\fIdirectory\fP]  [-timeout\fInum_minutes\fP]  [-mount_point\fImount_point\fP] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The daemon for the
CDE Subprocess Control service,
\fBdtspcd\fP, is not intended to be started directly by the user,
rather it should be started automatically by the inetd
daemon (see
\fBinetd\fP(1m)) in response to a CDE client
requesting a process to be started on the daemon\&'s host\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-auth_dir\fP \fIdirectory\fP" 10
The default authentication directory is the user\&'s
$HOME directory\&.
This option allows the system
administrator to use a different directory\&.
Note that
\fIdirectory\fP must be exported to hosts wishing
to use the
\fBdtspc\fP service\&.
\fIdirectory\fP - the name of the directory to use for authentication\&.
.IP "\fB-timeout\fP \fIminutes\fP" 10
By default, the dtspcd process will terminate if it does
not have any activity (process start or process stop)
for 10 minutes and
\fBdtspcd\fP has no child processes running\&.
To change the timeout, set
\fIminutes\fP to the
desired number of minutes\&.
To force the daemon to not use a timer,
set
\fIminutes\fP to -1\&.
\fIminutes\fP - the number of minutes for the timer\&.
.IP "\fB-mount_point\fP \fImount_point\fP" 10
The file system\&'s mount point is named
\fImount_point\&.\fP For example,
\fImount_point\fP could
be "/net" or "/nfs"\&.
The daemon sets the
environment variable
\fIDTMOUNTPOINT\fP to the
value of
\fImount_point\fP\&. This value
of
\fIDTMOUNTPOINT\fP will override all other
definitions of
\fIDTMOUNTPOINT\fP\&.
.IP "\fB-log\fP" 10
This option turns on logging of status information
to the file
\fB/var/dt/tmp/DTSPCD\&.log\fP\&. The information logged
includes the name of the client host, the client\&'s
username, error messages and the name of the file
used for authentication\&.
The default is to not do any logging\&.
.IP "\fB-debug\fP" 10
This option turns on logging of dtspc protocol
to the file
\fB/var/dt/tmp/DTSPCD\&.log\&.\fP The
protocol information logged includes
the name of the protocol and number of bytes
in the request\&.
The default is to not log the protocol\&.
.SH "AUTHENTICATION"
.PP
When a CDE client attempts to connect to a
\fBdtspcd\fP daemon,
the client sends the daemon its username\&.
The
daemon uses the username to determine the user\&'s
home directory on the daemon\&'s host\&.
The home
directory is used during authentication and it
must be readable by the daemon and writable by
the client\&.
Therefore, the user\&'s home directory
on the daemon\&'s host must be mounted to the client
host\&.
If the user\&'s home directory is not readable
and the
\fB-auth_dir\fP command line option is not used,
the directory
\fB/var/dt/tmp\fP will be used\&.
.PP
To use a directory other than the user\&'s home directory
for authentication, use the
\fB-auth_dir\fP command
line option\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The
\fBdtspcd\fP daemon is an Internet service that must
be registered in the file
\fB/etc/services\fP as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWdtspc      6112/tcp\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
and in the file
\fB/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CWdtspc  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd\fR
.fi
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MANAGEMENT"
.PP
The CDE Subprocess Control service allows
the user and system administrator to
create files of environment variable
definitions to be placed in the
processes environment before a remote
process is started\&.
See \fBdtspcdenv\fP(4) for more information\&.
.SH "OPERATING SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES"
.PP
On HP-UX, the file
\fB/usr/adm/inetd\&.sec\fP may be used to
control access to the
\fBdtspcd\fP daemon\&.
See
\fBinetd\&.sec\fP(4) for more information\&.
.SH "FILES"
.IP "\fB/usr/dt/bin/dtspcd\fP" 10
The CDE Subprocess Control daemon
.IP "\fB/etc/services\fP" 10
The Internet service name data base
.IP "\fB/etc/inted\&.conf\fP" 10
The inetd configuration file
.IP "\fB/etc/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP" 10
System-wide, locally defined environment variable
definitions used when a process is executed
.IP "\fB/usr/dt/config/dtspcdenv\fP" 10
System-wide, installed environment variable definitions
used when a process is executed
.IP "\fB$HOME/\&.dt/dtspcdenv\fP" 10

when a process is executed
.IP "\fB/var/dt/tmp/DTSPCD\&.log\fP" 10
The dtspcd log file
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Use the command line options
\fB-log\fP and
\fB-debug\fP (described above) to get diagnostic
information\&.
