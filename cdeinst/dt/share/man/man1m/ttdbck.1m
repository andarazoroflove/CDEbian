.TH "ttdbck" "user cmd"
.SH "NAME"
\fBttdbck\fP \(em display, check, or repair ToolTalk databases
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBttdbck\fP [\fIselection opts\fP]  [\fIdiagnosis opts\fP]  [\fIdisplay opts\fP]  [\fIrepair opts\fP]  [\fIdata-base-directory\fP]  [\&.\&.\&.] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBttdbck\fP is the ToolTalk database maintenance tool\&.
It allows direct inspection of ToolTalk spec data, detection of
inconsistencies, and repair of problems\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "data-base-directory" 10
Names the directory or directories containing the ToolTalk database to be
inspected or repaired\&. If no directories are named, the current directory is
assumed\&. If a directory path does not end in ``TT_DB\&'\&', ``TT_DB\&'\&'
is appended\&.
.IP "" 10
The user running the command must have read access to the files in the
directory to inspect the data and write access to repair the data\&.
Since ToolTalk databases are typically accessible only to root, this
command is normally run as root\&.
.SS "Selection options"
.PP
The selection options determine which specs in the database are displayed
or modified\&. If no selection options are given, all specs in the database
are displayed\&. To prevent massive accidental changes to ToolTalk
databases, no repair options except
\fB-I\fP are allowed unless a selection or
diagnosis option is given\&.
.IP "-f\  filename" 10
Restricts the set of specs to be inspected or modified to those which
describe objects in the named file\&. The file name can contain shell-style
wildcards which must be escaped to prevent the shell from expanding them\&.
.IP "-k\  objidkey" 10
An object id key, specifying a particular spec to be displayed or modified\&.
The object id key can be obtained from a previous invocation of
\fBttdbck\fP; one might display a set of specs, determine the one that needs repair, and
specify its key here\&.
.IP "-t\  type" 10
Restricts the set of specs to be inspected or modified to those with
otype
\fItype\&.\fP The type name can contain shell-style wildcards which must be escaped
to prevent the shell from expanding them\&.
.SS "Diagnosis options"
.PP
These options check for and report on inconsistencies in the selected specs\&.
Only specs selected by the selection options are checked\&. If a diagnosis
option is given, any display or repair option is applied only to specs which
fail the diagnostic check\&.
.IP "-b" 10
Check for badly formed specs: those which have no file or type or those
which have types not defined in the type database\&.
.IP "-x" 10
Check for specs which refer to files that no longer exist\&.
.SS "Display options"
.PP
These options determine which data is printed for each selected spec\&.
.IP "-i" 10
Display the object id (including the object id key\&.)
.IP "-m" 10
Display the mandatory data that must appear in every spec: the otype
of the object described by the spec and the file in which the spec is
stored\&.
.IP "-p" 10
Display all the properties and values for each selected spec\&.
.IP "-a" 10
Display all data (equivalent to specifying
\fB-imp\fP)
.SS "Repair options"
.IP "-I" 10
Invoke the NetISAM isrepair() function for all files accessed\&.
This action is applied before any other inspection or repair
action\&.
This option should be used when normal operations
return EBADFILE (error code 105)\&.
.IP "-F \ filename" 10
Change the file name for the selected specs to the supplied file name\&.
.IP "-T \ otypeid" 10
Change the type of the selected specs to the given otype\&.
.IP "-Z" 10
Remove the selected specs entirely\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IP "" 10
\fBttdbck\fP \fB-bxi\fP \fB/home\fP
.IP "" 10
In the /home/TT_DB directory, finds all badly formed specs and specs that
refer to non-existent files and prints their ids\&.
.IP "" 10
\fBttdbck\fP \fB-f\fP \fB/home/sample/data\fP \fB-F\fP \fB/home/sample/data1\fP \fB/home\fP
.IP "" 10
In the /home/TT_DB directory, finds all specs that refer to objects in
file /home/sample/data and changes them to refer to /home/sample/data1\&.
.IP "" 10
\fBttdbck\fP \fB-t\fP \fBSample_Otype_Name\fP \fB-Z\fP \fB/export/TT_DB\fP
.IP "" 10
In the /export/TT_DB directory, finds all specs that refer to objects
of type
\fISample_Otype_Name\fP and deletes the specs\&.
.SH "FILES"
.IP "/path/TT_DB" 10
ToolTalk database
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The
\fBttdbck\fP command should be run on the same machine where the TT_DB files
being inspected and repaired physically exist\&. That is, don\&'t try to access
the TT_DB files via NFS\&.
