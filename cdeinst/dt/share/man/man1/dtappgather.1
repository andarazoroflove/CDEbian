.SH "NAME"
\fBdtappgather\fP \(em gather application files for presentation by the
Application Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBdtappgather\fP [-r] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
Application Manager
presents personal, system, and factory applications in
an easy-to-access window\&.
The
Application Manager
is implemented as a special File Manager view of a
subdirectory that is built on a per-user, per-session basis\&.
The
\fBdtappgather\fP utility is responsible for creating and refreshing
the user\&'s
Application Manager
subdirectory\&.
.PP
The
\fBdtappgather\fP utility
is run at login and whenever the user invokes the
\fBReloadApps\fP action\&.
The user\&'s individual subdirectory for the
Application Manager,
\fB/var/dt/appconfig/appmanager/$DTUSERSESSION\fP, is opened when the user presses the Application Manager control
on the Front Panel\&.
.PP
The sequence of events is as follows:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
When the user logs in, the \fBXsession\fP script sources in the
\fBXsession\&.d\fP script that sets the \fBDTUSERSESSION\fP environment
variable\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
\fBXsession\fP then invokes the
\fBdtsearchpath\fP
utility to set the \fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP environment variable\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
After
\fBdtsearchpath\fP
returns with the \fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP assembled,
the \fBXsession\fP script calls
\fBdtappgather\fP\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
As its main function,
\fBdtappgather\fP traverses the \fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP,
examining each possible source of applications and, where
there are existing source subdirectories, creates symbolic links between
the source and the user\&'s \fBDTUSERSESSION\fP subdirectory\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Finally,
\fBdtappgather\fP turns off write permissions on the resulting subdirectory to ensure its
integrity\&.
.IP "" 10
A similar sequence occurs when the user double-clicks the \fBReloadApps\fP
action after logging in\&.
.IP "" 10
Although the value of the \fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP can be modified in a
local shell, the
Application Manager
view based on its value is not functional until you log out and
log back in\&.
Since this can be a tedious venture, you can verify the
Application Manager
view by executing
\fBdtsearchpath\fP(1) and
\fBdtappgather\fP in the local shell\&.
For
example, to add host
\fBtrout\fP as a system-wide
application server, set the
\fBdtsearchpath\fP(1) input environment variable,
\fIDTSPSYSAPPHOSTS\fP: \fBDTSPSYSAPPHOSTS=trout\fP: Then, execute
\fBdtsearchpath\fP(1) to update the
\fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP environment
variable\&.
\fBeval\fP \fB`dtsearchpath`\fP Finally, gather the new applications by executing
\fBdtappgather\fP\&. The
Application Manager
will show the new application groups but will not be functional\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fB-r\fP
option causes
\fBdtappgather\fP to retain the previous contents of the Application Manager, although
discarding broken links\&.
At login,
\fBdtappgather\fP destroys the user\&'s previous \fBDTUSERSESSION\fP subdirectory before
creating a new one\&.
At \fBReloadApps\fP time, the \fB-r\fP option
is used to minimize visual disruption of any opened
Application Manager
views\&.
.SH "RETURN"
.PP
The command always returns 0 (zero) for successful completion\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP "\fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP" 10
Set by the
\fBdtsearchpath\fP(1) utility\&.
\fBDTAPPSEARCHPATH\fP controls the places
where
\fBdtappgather\fP will gather applications\&.
The default locations consist of
\fB$HOME/\&.dt/appmanager\fP (for end users),
\fB/etc/dt/appconfig/appmanager/$LANG\fP (for system administrators), and
\fB/usr/dt/appconfig/appmanager/$LANG\fP (for factory applications)\&.
.IP "\fBDTUSERSESSION\fP" 10
Controls the location of the end user\&'s subdirectory where the
Application Manager will be rooted\&.
The subdirectory name includes
both the user\&'s \fI$LOGNAME\fP and \fI$DISPLAY\fP in order to
ensure the user\&'s view of the Application Manager remains consistent
across sessions\&.
.SH "LOCALES"
.PP
When searching for system administrator and factory default
Application Manager
files,
\fBdtappgather\fP always uses a value of \fI$LANG\fP equal to \fBC\fP\&.
When the
user picks a language at login, the corresponding \fI$LANG\fP
subdirectories are searched\&.
If multiple \fI$LANG\fP subdirectories exist
in \fB/etc/dt/appconfig/appmanager\fP, all \fI$LANG\fP subdirectories will
appear in the Application Manager; however, if multiple \fI$LANG\fP
subdirectories exist in
\fB/usr/dt/appconfig/appmanager\fP then the
language-specific subdirectory based on the current value of \fI$LANG\fP is
chosen instead of the \fBC\fP subdirectory\&.
Regardless of locale, all the action files that exist under the user\&'s
\fB$HOME/\&.dt/appmanager\fP subdirectory will be symbolically linked
to the user\&'s
Application Manager
subdirectory\&.
.SH "FILES"
.IP "\fB/usr/dt/bin/Xsession\fP" 10
Among its tasks at login,
the \fBXsession\fP script invokes
\fBdtsearchpath\fP(1), and then
\fBdtappgather\fP\&.
.IP "\fB/var/dt/appconfig/appmanager/$DTUSERSESSION\fP" 10
This subdirectory is where
\fBdtappgather\fP assembles the
Application Manager
view for the particular user and CDE session\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
In the case of multiple search locations having the same name,
\fBdtappgather\fP picks only the first and discards the rest\&.
For example, if the
system administrator sets
\fBDTSPSYSAPPHOSTS=tuna:,trout:\fP
and if both hosts, \fBtuna\fP and \fBtrout\fP, have an
\fB/etc/dt/appconfig/appmanager/C/Editors\fP folder, then only the
\fBEditors\fP folder from \fBtuna\fP (the first host) will appear
in the user\&'s Application Manager\&.
After building the user\&'s \fBDTUSERSESSION\fP,
\fBdtappgather\fP turns off write permissions on that subdirectory to disallow alteration
by the end user\&.
Although the end user can resize the
window and rearrange the icons within the window, the Application
Manager is intended to be a read-only source of local
and networked applications\&.
