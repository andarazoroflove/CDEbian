.SH NAME
ttauth \- ToolTalk authority file utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ttauth
[ \fB\-f\fP \fIauthfile\fP ] [ \fB\-vqib\fP ] [ \fIcommand arg ...\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIttauth\fP program is used to edit and display the authorization 
information used in connecting to ToolTalk.  This program is usually
used to extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in on 
another (as is the case when using remote logins or granting access to
other users).  Commands (described below) may be entered interactively,
on the \fIttauth\fP command line, or in scripts.  Note that this program
does \fBnot\fP contact the ToolTalk server, \fIttsession\fP.
Normally \fIttauth\fP is not used to create the authority file entry in
the first place; \fIttsession\fP does that.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be used with \fIttauth\fP.  They may be given 
individually (e.g., \fI\-q \-i\|\fP) or may combined (e.g., \fI\-qi\|\fP).
.TP 8
.B "\-f \fIauthfile\fP"
This option specifies the name of the authority file to use.  By default,
\fIttauth\fP will use the file specified by the TTAUTHORITY environment variable
or \fI\.TTauthority\fP in the user's home directory.
.TP 8
.B \-q
This option indicates that \fIttauth\fP should operate quietly and not print
unsolicited status messages.  This is the default if an \fIttauth\fP command is
is given on the command line or if the standard output is not directed to a
terminal.
.TP 8
.B \-v
This option indicates that \fIttauth\fP should operate verbosely and print
status messages indicating the results of various operations (e.g., how many
records have been read in or written out).  This is the default if \fIttauth\fP
is reading commands from its standard input and its standard output is
directed to a terminal.
.TP 8
.B \-i
This option indicates that \fIttauth\fP should ignore any authority file
locks.  Normally, \fIttauth\fP will refuse to read or edit any authority files
that have been locked by other programs (usually \fIttsession\fP or another 
\fIttauth\fP).
.TP 8
.B \-b
This option indicates that \fIttauth\fP should attempt to break any authority
file locks before proceeding.  Use this option only to clean up stale locks.
.SH COMMANDS
The following commands may be used to manipulate authority files:
.TP 8
.B "add \fIprotoname protodata netid authname authdata"
An authorization entry for the indicated ToolTalk session using the given
protocol name (\fIprotoname\fP), protocol data (\fIprotodata\fP), ToolTalk
session id (\fInetid\fP), authentication name (\fIauthname\fP), and
authentication data (\fIauthdata\fP) is added to the authorization file.
The protocol name should always be the string \fITT\fP.  The protocol data
should always be the empty string \fI""\fP.  The ToolTalk session id is
formatted string consisting of the ttsession program number, the ttsession
authorization level, the IP address of the host running ttsession, and the
RPC version number of the ttsession.  See the section
\fITTSESSION IDENTIFIERS\fP below for information on constructing ToolTalk
session id's for the authority file. 
The authentication name should always be the string
\fIMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1\fP.  The authentication data is specified as
an even-lengthed string of hexadecimal digits, each pair representing 
one octet.  The first digit of each pair gives the most significant 4 bits
of the octet, and the second digit of the pair gives the least significant 4
bits.  For example, a 32 character hexkey would represent a 128-bit value.

.TP 8
.B "[n]extract \fIfilename <protoname=$> <protodata=$> <netid=$> <authname=$>\fP"
Authorization entries which match the specified fields are written to the 
indicated file.  If the \fInextract\fP command is used, the entries are written
in a numeric format suitable for non-binary transmission (such as secure
electronic mail).  The extracted entries can be read back in using the 
\fImerge\fP and \fInmerge\fP commands.  If the filename consists of 
just a single dash, the entries will be written to the standard output.
.TP 8
.B "[n]list \fR\fI<protoname=$> <protodata=$> <netid=$> <authname=$>\fP"
Authorization entries which match the specified fields (or all if nothing
is specified) are printed on the standard output.  If the \fInlist\fP
command is used, entries will be shown in the numeric format used by 
the \fInextract\fP command; otherwise, they are shown in a textual format.
Key data is always displayed in the hexadecimal format given in the
description of the \fIadd\fP command.
.TP 8
.B "[n]merge \fR[\fIfilename1 <filename2> <filename3>\fP...]"
Authorization entries are read from the specified files and are merged into
the authorization database, superceding any matching existing entries. If
the \fInmerge\fP command is used, the numeric format given in the description
of the \fIextract\fP command is used.  If a filename consists of just a single
dash, the standard input will be read if it hasn't been read before.
.TP 8
.B "remove \fI<protoname=$> <protodata=$> <netid=$> <authname=$>\fR"
Authorization entries which match the specified fields are removed from the
authority file.
.TP 8
.B "source \fIfilename"
The specified file is treated as a script containing \fIttauth\fP commands
to execute.  Blank lines and lines beginning with a sharp sign (#) are 
ignored.  A single dash may be used to indicate the standard input, if it
hasn't already been read.
.TP 8
.B "info"
Information describing the authorization file, whether or not any changes
have been made, and from where \fIttauth\fP commands are being read
is printed on the standard output. 
.TP 8
.B "exit"
If any modifications have been made, the authority file is written out (if
allowed), and the program exits.  An end of file is treated as an implicit
\fIexit\fP command.
.TP 8
.B "quit"
The program exits, ignoring any modifications.  This may also be accomplished
by pressing the interrupt character.
.TP 8
.B "help [\fIstring\fP]"
A description of all commands that begin with the given string (or all
commands if no string is given) is printed on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B "?"
A short list of the valid commands is printed on the standard output.
.SH "TTSESSION IDENTIFIERS"
The ToolTalk session identifiers (\fInetid\fP) in the authority file and
used by the \fIadd\fP, \fI[n]extract\fP, \fI[n]list\fP, and \fIremove\fP
commands are derived from the TT_SESSION identifier constructed by
ttsession at startup.  Ttsession rendezvous with clients by writing the
TT_SESSION identifier as a property on the root window or as an environment
variable in the client's environment (see ttsession -c).  In addition, 
ttsession creates an entry in the user's authority file.  The authority
file entry has a \fInetid\fP component which is derived from the TT_SESSION
identifier.
.PP
The TT_SESSION identifier is composed of the following elements:
.sp
.nf
    e.g.:  TT_SESSION(STRING) = "01 1433 1342177279 1 1 2002 130.105.9.22 4"
           <Dummy Number>                    = 01
           <ttsession Process Id>            = 1433
           <ttsession Program Number>        = 1342177279
           <DummyNumber>                     = 1
           <ttsession Authorization Level>   = 1
           <ttsession UID>                   = 2002
           <Host IP Address>                 = 130.105.9.22
           <RPC Version Number>              = 4
.fi
.PP
The ToolTalk session identifiers (\fInetid\fP) in the authority file are
composed of the <\fIttsession Program Number\fP>,
<\fIttsession Authorization Level\fP>,
<\fIHost IP Address\fP>, and
<\fIRPC Version Number\fP> fields of the TT_SESSION identifier as follows:
.sp
.nf
    e.g:  1342177279/1/130.105.9.22/4
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The most common use for \fIttauth\fP is to extract the entry for the 
current ttsession, copy it to another machine, and merge it into the 
user's authority file on the remote machine:
.sp
.nf
    %  xprop -root | grep TT_SESSION
    TT_SESSION(STRING) = "01 1433 1342177279 1 1 2002 130.105.9.22 4"
    _SUN_TT_SESSION(STRING) = "01 1433 1342177279 1 1 2002 130.105.9.22 4"
    %  ttauth extract \- netid=1342177279/1/130.105.9.22/4 | rsh otherhost ttauth merge \-
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This \fIttauth\fP program uses the following environment variables:
.TP 8
.B TTAUTHORITY
to get the name of the authority file to use if the \fI\-f\fP option isn't
used.
.TP 8
.B HOME
to get the user's home directory if TTAUTHORITY isn't defined.
.SH FILES
.TP 8
.I $HOME/.TTauthority
default authority file if TTAUTHORITY isn't defined.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Users that have unsecure networks should take care to use encrypted 
file transfer mechanisms to copy authorization entries between machines.  
Similarly, the \fIMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1\fP protocol is not very useful in
unsecure environments.  Sites that are interested in additional security
may need to use encrypted authorization mechanisms such as Kerberos.
.PP
Spaces are currently not allowed in the protocol name.  Quoting could be
added for the truly perverse.
