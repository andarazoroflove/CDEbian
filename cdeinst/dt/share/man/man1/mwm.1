\fBmwm\fP \(em The Motif
Window Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBmwm\fP [\fIoptions\fP] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBmwm\fP window manager provides
functions that facilitate control (by the user and the programmer)
of elements of window state such as placement, size, icon/normal display,
and input-focus ownership\&.
.PP
The stand-alone window manager is not an integral part
of CDE and does not support communication with other components in the CDE
environment, such as the Style Manager and the Session Manager\&.
.SS "Options"
.IP "\fI-display\fP\ \fBdisplay\fP" 10
This option specifies the display to use; see \fBX\fP(1)\&.
.IP "\fI-xrm\fP\ \fBresourcestring\fP" 10
This option specifies a resource string to use\&.
.IP "\fI-multiscreen\fP" 10
This option causes \fBmwm\fP to manage all screens on
the display\&. Since \fBmwm\fP does this by default, this option
is of limited use\&. See the \fImultiScreen\fP resource for information
on managing a single screen\&.
.IP "\fI-name\fP\ \fBname\fP" 10
This option causes \fBmwm\fP to retrieve its resources
using the specified name, as in \fBname*resource\fP\&.
.IP "\fI-screens\fP\ \fBname\ [name\ [\&.\&.\&.]]\fP" 10
This option specifies the resource names to use for the screens managed
by \fBmwm\fP\&. If \fBmwm\fP is managing a single
screen, only the first name in the list is used\&. If \fBmwm\fP
is managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the screens in order,
starting with screen 0\&. Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second
name, and so on\&.
.SS "Appearance"
.PP
The following sections describe the basic default behaviors of windows,
icons, the icon box, input focus, and window stacking\&. The appearance and
behavior of the window manager can be altered by changing the configuration
of specific resources\&. Resources are defined under the heading "X DEFAULTS\&."
.SS "Screens"
.PP
By default, \fBmwm\fP manages only the single screen specified
by the \fI-display\fP option or the \fBDISPLAY\fP environment variable (by default, screen 0)\&. If the \fI-multiscreen\fP option is specified or if the \fImultiScreen\fP resource is True, \fBmwm\fP tries to manage all
the screens on the display\&.
.PP
When \fBmwm\fP is managing multiple screens, the \fI-screens\fP option can be used to give each screen a unique
resource name\&. The names are separated by blanks, for example, \fI-screens\fP scr0 scr1\&. If there are more screens than names,
resources for the remaining screens will be retrieved using the first name\&.
By default, the screen number is used for the screen name\&.
.SS "Windows"
.PP
Default \fBmwm\fP window frames have distinct components
with associated functions:
.IP "\fITitle\ Area\fP" 10
In addition to displaying the client\&'s title, the title area is used
to move the window\&. To move the window, place the pointer over the title area,
press button 1 and drag the window to a new location\&. By default, a wire
frame is moved during the drag to indicate the new location\&. When the button
is released, the window is moved to the new location\&.
.IP "\fITitle\ Bar\fP" 10
The title bar includes the title area, the minimize button, the maximize
button, and the window menu button\&. In shaped windows, such as round windows,
the title bar floats above the window\&.
.IP "\fIMinimize\ Button\fP" 10
To turn the window into an icon, click button 1 on the minimize button
(the frame box with a \fBsmall\fP square in it)\&.
.IP "\fIMaximize\ Button\fP" 10
To make the window fill the screen (or enlarge to the largest size allowed
by the configuration files), click button 1 on the maximize button (the frame
box with a \fBlarge\fP square in it)\&.
.IP "\fIWindow\ Menu\ Button\fP" 10
The window menu button is the frame box with a horizontal bar in it\&.
To pull down the window menu, press button 1\&. While pressing, drag the pointer
on the menu to your selection, then release the button when your selection
is highlighted\&. Pressing button 3 in the title bar or resize border handles
also posts the window menu\&. Alternately, you can click button 1 to pull down
the menu and keep it posted; then position the pointer and select\&. You can
also post the window menu by pressing <Shift> <Esc> or <Alt> <Space>\&.
Double-clicking button 1 with the pointer on the window menu button closes
the window\&.
.PP
The following table lists the contents of the window menu\&.

.IP "\fIResize\ Border\ Handles\fP" 10
To change the size of a window, move the pointer over a resize border
handle (the cursor changes), press button 1, and drag the window to a new
size\&. When the button is released, the window is resized\&. While dragging is
being done, a rubber-band outline is displayed to indicate the new window
size\&.
.IP "\fIMatte\fP" 10
An optional matte decoration can be added between the client area and
the window frame (see the \fImatteWidth\fP resource)\&. A
\fImatte\fP is not actually part of the window frame\&.
There is no functionality associated with a matte\&.
.SS "Icons"
.PP
Icons are small graphic representations of windows\&. A window can be
minimized (iconified) using the minimize button on the window frame\&. Icons
provide a way to reduce clutter on the screen\&.
.PP
Pressing mouse button 1 when the pointer is over an icon causes the
icon\&'s window menu to pop up\&. Releasing the button (press + release without
moving mouse = click) causes the menu to stay posted\&. The menu contains the
following selections:

.TE
.PP
Note that pressing button 3 over an icon also causes the icon\&'s window
menu to pop up\&. To make a menu selection, drag the pointer over the menu and
release button 3 when the desired item is highlighted\&.
.PP
Double-clicking button 1 on an icon invokes the \fBf\&.restore_and_raise\fP function and restores the icon\&'s associated window to its previous
state\&. For example, if a maximized window is iconified, double-clicking button
1 restores it to its maximized state\&. Double-clicking button 1 on the icon
box\&'s icon opens the icon box and allows access to the contained icons\&. (In
general, double-clicking a mouse button is a quick way to perform a function\&.)
Pressing <Shift> <Esc> or <Menu> (the pop-up menu key) causes the
icon window menu of the currently selected icon to pop up\&.
.SS "Icon Box"
.PP
When icons begin to clutter the screen, they can be packed into an icon
box\&. (To use an icon box, \fBmwm\fP must be started with the
icon box configuration already set\&.) The icon box is a \fBmwm\fP
window that holds client icons\&. It includes one or more scroll bars when there
are more window icons than the icon box can show at the same time\&.
.PP
Icons in the icon box can be manipulated with the mouse\&. The following
table summarizes the behavior of this interface\&. Button actions apply whenever
the pointer is on any part of the icon\&. Note that double-clicking an icon
in the icon box invokes the \fBf\&.restore_and_raise\fP function\&.

.TE
.PP
To pull down the window menu for the icon box itself, press button 1
with the pointer over the menu button for the icon box\&. The window menu of
the icon box differs from the window menu of a client window: The "Close"
selection is replaced with the "PackIcons Shift+Alt+F7" selection\&. When selected,
PackIcons packs the icons in the box to achieve neat rows with no empty slots\&.
.PP
You can also post the window menu by pressing <Shift>, <Esc> or
<Alt> <Space>\&. Pressing <Menu> (the pop-up menu key) causes the icon
window menu of the currently selected icon to pop up\&.
.SS "Input Focus"
.PP
The \fBmwm\fP window manager supports (by default) a keyboard
input focus policy of explicit selection\&. This means when a window is selected
to get keyboard input, it continues to get keyboard input until the window
is withdrawn from window management, another window is explicitly selected
to get keyboard input, or the window is iconified\&. Several resources control
the input focus\&. The client window with the keyboard input focus has the active
window appearance with a visually distinct window frame\&.
.PP
The following tables summarize the keyboard input focus selection behavior:

T}
.TE
.SS "Window Stacking"
.PP
There are two types of window stacks: global window stacks and an application\&'s
local family window stack\&.
.PP
The global stacking order of windows may be changed as a result of setting
the keyboard input focus, iconifying a window, or performing a window manager
window stacking function\&. When keyboard focus policy is explicit the default
value of the \fIfocusAutoRaise\fP resource is True\&. This causes
a window to be raised to the top of the stack when it receives input focus,
for example, by pressing button 1 on the title bar\&. The key actions defined
in the previous table will thus raise the window receiving focus to the top
of the stack\&.
.PP
In pointer mode, the default value of \fIfocusAutoRaise\fP
is False, that is, the window stacking order is not changed when a window
receives keyboard input focus\&. The following key actions can be used to cycle
through the global window stack\&.
.TS
tab();
lw(1.567982i) lw(3.932018i).
Key ActionFunction Description
[Alt][ESC]T{
Place top window on bottom of stack\&.
T}
[Alt][Shift][ESC]T{
Place bottom window on top of stack\&.
T}
.TE
.PP
By default, a window\&'s icon is placed on the bottom of the stack when
the window is iconified; however, the default can be changed by the \fIlowerOnIconify\fP resource\&.
.PP
Transient windows (secondary windows such a dialog boxes) stay above
their parent windows by default; however, an application\&'s local family stacking
order may be changed to allow a transient window to be placed below its parent
top-level window\&. The following arguments show the modification of the stacking
order for the \fBf\&.lower\fP function\&.
.IP "\fBf\&.lower\fP" 10
Lowers the transient window within the family (staying above the parent)
and lowers the family in the global window stack\&.
.IP "\fBf\&.lower\fP\ [ \fIwithin\fP]" 10
Lowers the transient window within the family (staying above the parent)
but does not lower the family in the global window stack\&.
.IP "\fBf\&.lower\fP\ [\fIfreeFamily\fP ]" 10
Lowers the window free from its family stack (below the parent), but
does not lower the family in the global window stack\&.
.PP
The arguments \fIwithin\fP and \fIfreeFamily\fP can also be used with \fBf\&.raise\fP
and \fBf\&.raise_lower\fP\&.
.SS "Session Management"
.PP
The window manager is an X Session Management Protocol aware client\&. It responds to SaveYourself
(and other associated messages) by saving the geometries of its clients to a state file\&. 
\fBmwm\fP can then be restarted by the XSMP session manager\&.
The default location for the state file is \fB$HOME/\&.mwmclientdb\fP\&.
This location can be overriden with the resource \fBsessionClientDB\fP\&.
.SS "X Resources"
.PP
The \fBmwm\fP command is configured from its resource
database\&. This database is built from the following sources\&. They are listed
in order of precedence, low to high:
.PP
\fB/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mwm\fP
.PP
\fB$HOME/Mwm\fP
.PP
\fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fP root window property or \fB$HOME/\&.Xdefaults\fP
.PP
\fBXENVIRONMENT\fP variable or \fB$HOME/\&.Xdefaults-host\fP
.PP
\fBmwm\fP command line options
.PP
The file names \fB/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mwm\fP and \fB$HOME/Mwm\fP represent customary locations for these files\&. The actual
location of the system-wide class resource file may depend on the \fBXFILESEARCHPATH\fP environment variable and the
current language environment\&. The actual location of the user-specific class
resource file may depend on the \fBXUSERFILESEARCHPATH\fP and \fBXAPPLRESDIR\fP
environment variables and the current language environment\&.
.PP
Entries in the resource database may refer to other resource files for
specific types of resources\&. These include files that contain bitmaps, fonts,
and \fBmwm\fP specific resources such as menus and behavior
specifications (for example, button and key bindings)\&.
.PP
\fIMwm\fP is the resource class name of \fBmwm\fP and \fBmwm\fP is the default resource name used by \fBmwm\fP to look up resources\&. the \fI-screens\fP
command line option specifies resource names, such as "mwm_b+w" and "mwm_color"\&.)
In the following discussion of resource specification, "Mwm" and "mwm" (and
the aliased \fBmwm\fP resource names) can be used interchangeably,
but "mwm" takes precedence over "Mwm"\&.
.PP
The \fBmwm\fP command uses the following types of resources:
.IP "\fBComponent Appearance Resources:\fP" 10
These resources specify appearance attributes of window manager user
interface components\&. They can be applied to the appearance of window manager
menus, feedback windows (for example, the window reconfiguration feedback
window), client window frames, and icons\&.
.IP "\fBGeneral Appearance and Behavior Resources:\fP" 10
These resources specify \fBmwm\fP appearance and behavior
(for example, window management policies)\&. They are not set separately for
different \fBmwm\fP user interface components\&. They apply to
all screens and workspaces\&.
.IP "\fBScreen Specific Appearance and Behavior Resources:\fP" 10
These resources specify the appearance and behavior of \fBmwm\fP elements that are settable on a per-screen basis\&.
.IP "\fBClient Specific Resources:\fP" 10
These \fBmwm\fP resources can be set for a particular
client window or class of client windows\&. They specify client-specific icon
and client window frame appearance and behavior\&.
.PP
Resource identifiers can be either a resource name (for example, foreground)
or a resource class (for example, Foreground)\&. If the value of a resource
is a filename and if the filename is prefixed by "~/", then it is relative
to the path contained in the \fBHOME\fP
environment variable (generally the user\&'s home directory)\&.
.SS "Component Appearance Resources"
.PP
The syntax for specifying component appearance resources that apply
to window manager icons, menus, and client window frames is \fIMwm*\fP \fBresource_id\fP
.PP
For example, \fIMwm*foreground\fP is used to specify
the foreground color for \fBmwm\fP menus, icons, client window
frames, and feedback dialogs\&.
.PP
The syntax for specifying component appearance resources that apply
to a particular \fBmwm\fP component is \fIMwm*\fP[\fImenu\fP|\fIicon\fP|\fIclient\fP|\fIfeedback\fP] \fI*\fP\fBresource_id\fP
.PP
If \fBmenu\fP is specified, the resource is applied only
to \fBmwm\fP menus; if \fBicon\fP is specified,
the resource is applied to icons; and if \fBclient\fP is specified,
the resource is applied to client window frames\&. For example, \fIMwm*icon*foreground\fP is used to specify the foreground color for \fBmwm\fP
icons, \fIMwm*menu*foreground\fP specifies the foreground
color for \fBmwm\fP menus, and \fIMwm*client*foreground\fP is used to specify the foreground color for \fBmwm\fP
client window frames\&.
.PP
The appearance of the title area of a client window frame (including
window management buttons) can be separately configured\&. The syntax for configuring
the title area of a client window frame is \fIMwm*client*title*\fP \fBresource_id\fP
.PP
For example, \fIMwm*client*title*foreground\fP specifies
the foreground color for the title area\&. Defaults for title area resources
are based on the values of the corresponding client window frame resources\&.
.PP
The appearance of menus can be configured based on the name of the menu\&.
The syntax for specifying menu appearance by name is \fIMwm*menu*\fP \fBmenu_name\fP\fI*\fP\fBresource_id\fP
.PP
For example, \fIMwm*menu*my_menu*foreground\fP specifies
the foreground color for the menu named \fImy_menu\fP\&. The
user can also specify resources for window manager menu components, that is,
the gadgets that comprise the menu\&. These may include for example, a menu
title, title separator, one or more buttons, and separators\&. If a menu contains
more than one instance of a class, such as multiple PushButtonGadgets, the
name of the first instance is "PushButtonGadget1", the second is "PushButtonGadget2",
and so on\&. The following list identifies the naming convention used for window
manager menu components:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Menu Title LabelGadget - "TitleName"
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Menu Title SeparatorGadget - "TitleSeparator"
.IP "   \(bu" 6
CascadeButtonGadget - "CascadeButtonGadget<n>"
.IP "   \(bu" 6
PushButtonGadget - "PushButtonGadget<n>"
.IP "   \(bu" 6
SeparatorGadget - "SeparatorGadget<n>"
.PP
Refer to the man page for each class for a list of resources that can
be specified\&.

\(dgThe resource doubleClickTime is included for backward compatibility\&.
Use of the Xt resource multiClickTime is preferred\&.
.IP "\fIautoKeyFocus\fP\ (class\  \fIAutoKeyFocus\fP)" 10
This resource is available only when the keyboard input focus policy
is explicit\&. If \fIautoKeyFocus\fP is given a value of True,
then when a window with the keyboard input focus is withdrawn from window
management or is iconified, the focus is set to the previous window that had
the focus\&. If the value given is False, there is no automatic setting of the
keyboard input focus\&. It is recommended that both \fIautoKeyFocus\fP and \fIstartupKeyFocus\fP be True to work with
tear off menus\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fIautoRaiseDelay\fP\ (class\  \fIAutoRaiseDelay\fP)" 10
This resource is available only when the \fIfocusAutoRaise\fP
resource is True and the keyboard focus policy is pointer\&. The \fIautoRaiseDelay\fP resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds)
that \fBmwm\fP will wait before raising a window after it gets
the keyboard focus\&. The default value of this resource is 500 (ms)\&.
.IP "\fIbitmapDirectory\fP\ (class\  \fIBitmapDirectory\fP)" 10
This resource identifies a directory to be searched for bitmaps referenced
by \fBmwm\fP resources\&. This directory is searched if a bitmap
is specified without an absolute pathname\&. The default value for this resource
is BR /usr/include/X11/bitmaps\&. The directory \fB/usr/include/X11/bitmaps\fP
represents the customary locations for this directory\&. The actual
location of this directory may vary on some systems\&. If the bitmap is not
found in the specified directory, \fBXBMLANGPATH\fP is searched\&.
.IP "\fIclientAutoPlace\fP\ (class\  \fIClientAutoPlace\fP)" 10
This resource determines the position of a window when the window has
not been given a program- or user-specified position\&. With a value of True,
windows are positioned with the top left corners of the frames offset horizontally
and vertically\&. A value of False causes the currently configured position
of the window to be used\&. In either case, \fBmwm\fP will attempt
to place the windows totally on-screen\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fIcolormapFocusPolicy\fP\ (class\  \fIColormapFocusPolicy\fP)" 10
This resource indicates the colormap focus policy that is to be used\&.
If the resource value is explicit, a colormap selection action is done on
a client window to set the colormap focus to that window\&. If the value is
pointer, the client window containing the pointer has the colormap focus\&.
If the value is keyboard, the client window that has the keyboard input focus
has the colormap focus\&. The default value for this resource is keyboard\&.
.IP "\fIconfigFile\fP\ (class\  \fIConfigFile\fP)" 10
The resource value is the pathname for a \fBmwm\fP resource
description file\&. If the pathname begins with "~/", \fBmwm\fP
considers it to be relative to the user\&'s home directory (as specified by
the \fBHOME\fP environment variable)\&.
If the \fBLANG\fP environment variable
is set, \fBmwm\fP looks for \fI$HOME/$LANG\fP/ \fBconfigFile\fP\&. If that file does not exist or if \fBLANG\fP is not set, \fBmwm\fP looks for
\fB$HOME\fP/\fBconfigFile\fP\&. If the \fIconfigFile\fP pathname does not begin with "~/" or "/", \fBmwm\fP considers it to be relative to the current working directory\&. If
the \fIconfigFile\fP resource is not specified
or if that file does not exist, \fBmwm\fP uses several default
paths to find a configuration file\&. The order of the search is shown below: \fB$HOME/\&.dt/$LANG/mwmrc\fP \fB$HOME/\&.dt/mwmrc\fP \fB/etc/dt/config/$LANG/sys\&.mwmrc\fP\(dg

implementation dependent\&.
.IP "\fIdeiconifyKeyFocus\fP\ (class\  \fIDeiconifyKeyFocus\fP)" 10
This resource applies only when the keyboard input focus policy is explicit\&.
If a value of True is used, a window receives the keyboard input focus when
it is normalized (deiconified)\&. True is the default value\&.
.IP "\fIdoubleClickTime\fP\ (class\  \fIDoubleClickTime\fP)" 10
This resource is used to set the maximum time (in ms) between the clicks
(button presses) that make up a double-click\&. The use of this resource is
deprecated\&. Use the Xt resource \fImultiClickTime\fP instead\&.
The value of \fIdoubleClickTime\fP dynamically defaults to
the value of \fImultiClickTime\fP\&.
.IP "\fIenableWarp\fP\ (class\  \fIEnableWarp\fP)" 10
The default value of this resource, True, causes \fBmwm\fP
to warp the pointer to the center of the selected window during keyboard-controlled
resize and move operations\&. Setting the value to False causes \fBmwm\fP to leave the pointer at its original place on the screen, unless
the user explicitly moves it with the cursor keys or pointing device\&.
.IP "\fIenforceKeyFocus\fP\ (class\  \fIEnforceKeyFocus\fP)" 10
If this resource is given a value of True, the keyboard input focus
is always explicitly set to selected windows even if there is an indication
that they are "globally active" input windows\&. (An example of a globally active
window is a scroll bar that can be operated without setting the focus to that
client\&.) If the resource is False, the keyboard input focus is not explicitly
set to globally active windows\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fIframeStyle\fP\ (class\  \fIframeStyle\fP)" 10
If this resource is given a value of "slab", the the window manager
frame is drawn such that the client area appears to be at the same height
as the top of the window frame\&. If the resource is set to "recessed", the
window frame is drawn such that the client area appears lower than the top
of the window frame\&. The default value is "recessed"\&.
.IP "\fIiconAutoPlace\fP\ (class\  \fIIconAutoPlace\fP)" 10
This resource indicates whether the window manager arranges icons in
a particular area of the screen or places each icon where the window was when
it was iconified\&. The value True indicates that icons are arranged in a particular
area of the screen, determined by the \fIiconPlacement\fP resource\&.
The value False indicates that an icon is placed at the location of the window
when it is iconified\&. The default is True\&.
.IP "\fIiconClick\fP\ (class\  \fIIconClick\fP)" 10
When this resource is given the value of True, the system menu is posted
and left posted when an icon is clicked\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fIinteractivePlacement\fP\ (class\  \fIInteractivePlacement\fP)" 10
This resource controls the initial placement of new windows on the screen\&.
If the value is True, the pointer shape changes before a new window is placed
on the screen to indicate to the user that a position should be selected for
the upper-left hand corner of the window\&. If the value is False, windows are
placed according to the initial window configuration attributes\&. The default
value of this resource is False\&.
.IP "\fIkeyboardFocusPolicy\fP\ (class\  \fIKeyboardFocusPolicy\fP)" 10
If set to pointer, the keyboard focus policy is to have the keyboard
focus set to the client window that contains the pointer (the pointer could
also be in the client window decoration that \fBmwm\fP adds)\&.
If set to explicit, the policy is to have the keyboard focus set to a client
window when the user presses button 1 with the pointer on the client window
or any part of the associated \fBmwm\fP decoration\&. The default
value for this resource is explicit\&.
.IP "\fIlowerOnIconify\fP\ (class\  \fILowerOnIconify\fP)" 10
If this resource is given the default value of True, a window\&'s icon
appears on the bottom of the window stack when the window is minimized (iconified)\&.
A value of False places the icon in the stacking order at the same place as
its associated window\&. The default value of this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fImoveThreshold\fP\ (class\  \fIMoveThreshold\fP)" 10
This resource is used to control the sensitivity of dragging operations
that move windows and icons\&. The value of this resource is the number of pixels
that the locator is moved with a button down before the move operation is
initiated\&. This is used to prevent window/icon movement when you click or
double-click and there is unintentional pointer movement with the button down\&.
The default value of this resource is 4 (pixels)\&.
.IP "\fImultiScreen\fP\ (class\  \fIMultiScreen\fP)" 10
This resource, if True, causes \fBmwm\fP to manage all
the screens on the display\&. If False, \fBmwm\fP manages only
a single screen\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fIpassButtons\fP\ (class\  \fIPassButtons\fP)" 10
This resource indicates whether or not button press events are passed
to clients after they are used to do a window manager function in the client
context\&. If the resource value is False, the button press is not passed to
the client\&. If the value is True, the button press is passed to the client
window\&. The window manager function is done in either case\&. The default value
for this resource is False\&.
.IP "\fIpassSelectButton\fP\ (class\  \fIPassSelectButton\fP)" 10
This resource indicates whether or not to pass the select button press
events to clients after they are used to do a window manager function in the
client context\&. If the resource value is False, then the button press will
not be passed to the client\&. If the value is True, the button press is passed
to the client window\&. The window manager function is done in either case\&.
The default value for this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fIpositionIsFrame\fP\ (class\  \fIPositionIsFrame\fP)" 10
This resource indicates how client window position information (from
the \fIWM_NORMAL_HINTS\fP property and from configuration requests)
is to be interpreted\&. If the resource value is True, the information is interpreted
as the position of the \fBmwm\fP client window frame\&. If the
value is False, it is interpreted as being the position of the client area
of the window\&. The default value of this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fIpositionOnScreen\fP\ (class\  \fIPositionOnScreen\fP)" 10
This resource is used to indicate that windows should initially be placed
(if possible) so that they are not clipped by the edge of the screen (if the
resource value is True)\&. If a window is larger than the size of the screen,
at least the upper-left corner of the window is on-screen\&. If the resource
value is False, windows are placed in the requested position even if totally
off-screen\&. The default value of this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fIquitTimeout\fP\ (class\  \fIQuitTimeout\fP)" 10
This resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) that \fBmwm\fP will wait for a client to update the \fIWM_COMMAND\fP
property after \fBmwm\fP has sent the \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fP message\&. The default value of this resource is 1000 (ms)\&. (Refer
to the \fBf\&.kill\fP function description for additional information\&.)
.IP "\fIraiseKeyFocus\fP\ (class\  \fIRaiseKeyFocus\fP)" 10
This resource is available only when the keyboard input focus policy
is explicit\&. When set to True, this resource specifies that a window raised
by means of the \fBf\&.normalize_and_raise\fP function also receives
the input focus\&. The default value of this resource is False\&.
.IP "\fIrefreshByClearing\fP\ (class\  \fIRefreshByClearing\fP)" 10
This resource determines the mechanism used to refresh a window (or
the screen) when the \fBf\&.refresh_win\fP (\fBf\&.refresh\fP) function is executed\&. When set to True, an XClearArea is performed
over the window for \fBf\&.refresh_win\fP\&. When set to False,
a covering window is created and destroyed over the top of the window to be
refreshed\&. If the function is \fBf\&.refresh\fP and this resource
is set to True, then an XClearArea is performed over every window on the screen\&.
If the resource is set to False, then one large window covering the entire
screen is created and destroyed\&. The default value of this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fIrootButtonClick\fP\ (class\  \fIRootButtonClick\fP)" 10
The \fIrootButtonClick\fP resource controls whether the
a click on the root window will post the root menu in a "sticky" mode\&. If
this resource is set to True, a button click on the root window will post
the menu bound to the button down event for that button in a "sticky" fashion\&.
If this resource is set to False, then the same button click would only cause
the menu to flash as it would be unposted once the button up event is seen\&.
The criterion used to determine if it is a button click is if the pointer
doesn\&'t move between the button down and button up events\&. The default value
for this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fIscreens\fP\ (class\  \fIScreens\fP)" 10
This resource specifies the resource names to use for the screens managed
by \fBmwm\fP\&. If \fBmwm\fP is managing a single
screen, only the first name in the list is used\&. If \fBmwm\fP
is managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the screens in order,
starting with screen 0\&. Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second
name, and so on\&. The default screen names are 0, 1, and so on\&.
.IP "\fIsessionClientDB\fP\ (class\  \fISessionClientDB\fP)" 10
This resource identifies a file name to use as a root when saving state
at the request of an XSMP session manager\&. When the session is saved, the window manager will then reuse
the file name by automatically incrementing a suffix\&.
.IP "\fIshowFeedback\fP\ (class\  \fIShowFeedback\fP)" 10
This resource controls whether or not feedback windows or confirmation
dialogs are displayed\&. A feedback window shows a client window\&'s initial
placement and shows position and size during move and resize operations\&.
Confirmation dialogs can be displayed for certain operations\&. The value for
this resource is a list of names of the feedback options to be enabled or
disabled; the names must be separated by a space\&. If an option is preceded
by a minus sign, that option is excluded from the list\&. The \fBsign\fP of the first item in the list determines the initial set of options\&.
If the sign of the first option is minus, \fBmwm\fP assumes
all options are present and starts subtracting from that set\&. If the sign
of the first decoration is plus (or not specified), \fBmwm\fP
starts with no options and builds up a list from the resource\&.

A horizontal (vertical) layout value should not be used for both the \fBprimary_layout\fP and the \fBsecondary_layout\fP (for
example, don\&'t use top for the \fBprimary_layout\fP and bottom
for the \fBsecondary_layout\fP)\&.
.PP
The \fBprimary_layout\fP indicates whether, when an icon
placement is done, the icon is placed in a row or a column and the direction
of placement\&. The \fBsecondary_layout\fP indicates where to place
new rows or columns\&. For example, top right indicates that icons should be
placed top to bottom on the screen and that columns should be added from right
to left on the screen\&.
.PP
The default placement is left bottom (icons are placed left to right
on the screen, with the first row on the bottom of the screen, and new rows
added from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen)\&. A \fBtight\fP value places icons with zero spacing in between icons\&. This
value is useful for aesthetic reasons, as well as X-terminals with small screens\&.
.IP "\fIiconPlacementMargin\fP\ (class\  \fIIconPlacementMargin\fP)" 10
This resource sets the distance between the edge of the screen and the
icons that are placed along the edge of the screen\&. The value should be greater
than or equal to 0\&. A default value (see below) is used if the value specified
is invalid\&. The default value for this resource is equal to the space between
icons as they are placed on the screen (this space is based on maximizing
the number of icons in each row and column)\&.
.IP "\fIkeyBindings\fP\ (class\  \fIKeyBindings\fP)" 10
This resource identifies the set of key bindings for window management
functions\&. If specified, these key bindings \fBreplace\fP the
built-in default bindings\&. The named set of key bindings is specified in \fBmwm\fP resource description file\&. The default value for this resource
is "DefaultKeyBindings"\&.
.IP "\fIlimitResize\fP\ (class\  \fILimitResize\fP)" 10
If this resource is True, the user is not allowed to resize a window
to greater than the maximum size\&. The default value for this resource is True\&.
.IP "\fImaximumMaximumSize\fP\ (class\  \fIMaximumMaximumSize\fP)" 10
This resource is used to limit the maximum size of a client window as
set by the user or client\&. The resource value is \fBwidth\fP\fIx\fP\fBheight\fP (for example, 1024x1024)
where the width and height are in pixels\&. The default value of this resource
is twice the screen width and height\&.
.IP "\fImoveOpaque\fP\ (class\  \fIMoveOpaque\fP)" 10
This resource controls whether the actual window is moved or a rectangular
outline of the window is moved\&. A default value of False displays a rectangular
outline on moves\&.
.IP "\fIresizeBorderWidth\fP\ (class\  \fIResizeBorderWidth\fP)" 10
This resource specifies the width (in pixels) of a client window frame
border with resize handles\&. The specified border width includes the 3-D shadows\&.
The default value is based on the size and resolution of the screen\&.
.IP "\fIresizeCursors\fP\ (class\  \fIResizeCursors\fP)" 10
This is used to indicate whether the resize cursors are always displayed
when the pointer is in the window size border\&. If True, the cursors are shown,
otherwise the window manager cursor is shown\&. The default value is True\&.
.IP "\fItransientDecoration\fP\ (class\  \fITransientDecoration\fP)" 10
This controls the amount of decoration that \fBmwm\fP
puts on transient windows\&. The decoration specification is exactly the same
as for the \fIclientDecoration\fP (client specific) resource\&.
Transient windows are identified by the \fIWM_TRANSIENT_FOR\fP
property, which is added by the client to indicate a relatively temporary
window\&. The default value for this resource is menu title (that is, transient
windows have frame borders and a titlebar with a window menu button)\&.
.IP "" 10
An application can also specify which decorations \fBmwm\fP
should apply to its windows\&. If it does so, \fBmwm\fP applies
only those decorations indicated by both the application and the \fItransientDecoration\fP resource\&. Otherwise, \fBmwm\fP
applies the decorations indicated by the \fItransientDecoration\fP
resource\&. For more information see the description of \fBXmNmwmDecorations\fP on the \fBVendorShell\fP(3)
reference page\&.
.IP "\fItransientFunctions\fP\ (class\  \fITransientFunctions\fP)" 10
This resource is used to indicate which window management functions
are applicable (or not applicable) to transient windows\&. The function specification
is exactly the same as for the \fIclientFunctions\fP (client
specific) resource\&. The default value for this resource is -minimize -maximize\&.
.IP "" 10
An application can also specify which functions \fBmwm\fP
should apply to its windows\&. If it does so, \fBmwm\fP applies
only those functions indicated by both the application and the \fItransientFunctions\fP resource\&. Otherwise, \fBmwm\fP
applies the functions indicated by the \fItransientFunctions\fP
resource\&. For more information see the description of \fBXmNmwmFunctions\fP on the \fBVendorShell\fP(3) reference
page\&.
.IP "\fIuseIconBox\fP\ (class\  \fIUseIconBox\fP)" 10
If this resource is given a value of True, icons are placed in an icon
box\&. When an icon box is not used, the icons are placed on the root window
(default value)\&.
.SS "Client Specific Resources"
.PP
The syntax for specifying client specific resources is
.PP
\fIMwm*\fP\fBclient_name_or_class\fP \fI*\fP\fBresource_id\fP
.PP
For example, \fIMwm*mterm*windowMenu\fP is used to specify
the window menu to be used with mterm clients\&. The syntax for specifying client
specific resources for all classes of clients is
.PP
\fIMwm*\fP\fBresource_id\fP
.PP
Specific client specifications take precedence over the specifications
for all clients\&. For example, \fIMwm*windowMenu\fP is used
to specify the window menu to be used for all classes of clients that don\&'t
have a window menu specified\&.
.PP
The syntax for specifying resource values for windows that have an unknown
name and class (that is, windows that do not have a \fBWM_CLASS\fP
property associated with them) is
.PP
\fIMwm*defaults*\fP\fBresource_id\fP

.IP "\fIclientDecoration\fP\ (class\  \fIClientDecoration\fP)" 10
This resource controls the amount of window frame decoration\&. The resource
is specified as a list of decorations to specify their inclusion in the frame\&.
If a decoration is preceded by a minus sign, that decoration is excluded from
the frame\&. The \fBsign\fP of the first item in the list determines
the initial amount of decoration\&. If the sign of the first decoration is minus, \fBmwm\fP assumes all decorations are present and starts subtracting
from that set\&. If the sign of the first decoration is plus (or not specified),
then \fBmwm\fP starts with no decoration and builds up a list
from the resource\&.

.IP "\fImaximumClientSize\fP\ (class\  \fIMaximumClientSize\fP)" 10
This resource is either a size specification or a direction that indicates
how a client window is to be maximized\&. The resource value can be specified
as a size specification \fBwidth\fP\fIx\fP\fBheight\fP\&. The width and height are interpreted in
the units that the client uses (for example, for terminal emulators this is
generally characters)\&. Alternately, "vertical" or "horizontal" can be specified
to indicate the direction in which the client maximizes\&.
.IP "" 10
If this resource is not specified, the maximum size from the \fIWM_NORMAL_HINTS\fP property is used if set\&. Otherwise the default
value is the size where the client window with window management borders fills
the screen\&. When the maximum client size is not determined by the \fImaximumClientSize\fP resource, the \fImaximumMaximumSize\fP
resource value is used as a constraint on the maximum size\&.
.IP "\fIuseClientIcon\fP\ (class\  \fIUseClientIcon\fP)" 10
If the value given for this resource is True, a client-supplied icon
image takes precedence over a user-supplied icon image\&. The default value
