\fBvoid \fBXmTransferDone\fP\fR(
\fBXtPointer \fBtransfer_id\fR\fR,
\fBXmTransferStatus \fBstatus\fR\fR);
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBXmTransferDone\fP completes an already-initiated data transfer
operation\&.
An application can call this routine from an
\fBXmNdestinationCallback\fP procedure or any function called as a
result, including the selection procedures called as a result of calls
to \fBXmTransferValue\fP\&.
.PP
The caller of \fBXmTransferDone\fP supplies an identifier for the
transfer operation and an indication of the completion status\&.
\fBXmTransferDone\fP causes any remaining transfers for the operation to
be discarded\&.
.IP "\fBtransfer_id\fP" 10
Specifies a unique indentifier for the data transfer operation\&.
The value must be the same as the value of the \fBtransfer_id\fP member
of the \fBXmDestinationCallbackStruct\fR passed to the
\fBXmNdestinationCallback\fP procedure\&.
.IP "\fIstatus\fP" 10
Specifies the completion status of the data transfer\&.
Following are the possible values:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmTRANSFER_DONE_SUCCEED\fP" 10
The transfer was completed successfully\&.
This status has the following additional effects:
.RS
.IP "   \(bu" 6
For a move operation, the selection owner receives a request to convert
the selection to the \fBDELETE\fP target\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
If a \fBTRANSACT\fP operation is in progress, the owner receives a
request to commit the transaction\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
If a \fBPERSIST\fP or \fB_MOTIF_SNAPSHOT\fP operation is in progress,
the owner receives a notification that the operation is finished\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
The widget class destination procedure is not called\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBXmTRANSFER_DONE_FAIL\fP" 10
The transfer was completed unsuccessfully\&.
This status has the following additional effects:
.RS
.IP "   \(bu" 6
For a move operation, the selection owner does not receive a request to
convert the selection to the \fBDELETE\fP target\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
For a drag and drop operation, the DropTransfer\&'s
\fBXmNtransferStatus\fP is set to \fBXmTRANSFER_FAILURE\fP\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
If a \fBTRANSACT\fP operation is in progress, the owner receives a
request to abort the transaction\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
If a \fBPERSIST\fP or \fB_MOTIF_SNAPSHOT\fP operation is in
progress, the owner receives a notification that the operation
is finished\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
The widget class destination procedure is not called\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBXmTRANSFER_DONE_CONTINUE\fP" 10
This status has the same effect as \fBXmTRANSFER_DONE_SUCCEED\fP, except
that if a \fBPERSIST\fP or \fB_MOTIF_SNAPSHOT\fP operation is
in progress, the
owner does not receive a notification that the operation is finished\&.
.IP "\fBXmTRANSFER_DONE_DEFAULT\fP" 10
The widget class destination procedure is called\&.
Further effects depend on the actions of that procedure\&.
