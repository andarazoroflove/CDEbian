.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBXmClipboardCopy\fP
copies a data item to temporary storage\&.
The data item is moved from temporary storage
to the clipboard data structure when a
call to \fBXmClipboardEndCopy\fP is made\&.
Additional calls to \fBXmClipboardCopy\fP before a call to
\fBXmClipboardEndCopy\fP add
additional data item formats to the same data item or
append data to an existing format\&. Formats are described in the
\fIInter-Client Communication Conventions Manual\fP (ICCCM) as targets\&.
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fP Do not call \fBXmClipboardCopy\fP before a call to
\fBXmClipboardStartCopy\fP has been made\&. The latter function allocates
temporary storage required by \fBXmClipboardCopy\fP\&.
.PP
If the \fIbuffer\fP argument is NULL, the data is considered
to be passed by name\&.
When data that
has been passed by name is later requested by another application, the
application that owns the data receives a callback with a request for
the data\&. The application that owns the data must then transfer the
data to the clipboard with the \fBXmClipboardCopyByName\fP function\&.
When a data item that was passed by name is deleted
from the clipboard, the application that owns the data receives a
callback stating that the data is no longer needed\&.
.PP
For information on the callback function, see the callback argument
description for \fBXmClipboardStartCopy\fP\&.
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 10
Specifies a pointer to the \fBDisplay\fR structure that was returned in a
previous call to \fBXOpenDisplay\fP or \fBXtDisplay\fP\&.
.IP "\fIwindow\fP" 10
Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates the application window to the
clipboard\&. The widget\&'s window ID can be obtained through
\fBXtWindow\fP\&.
The same application instance should pass the same window ID to each of the
clipboard functions that it calls\&.
.IP "\fIitem_id\fP" 10
Specifies the number assigned to this data item\&.
This number was returned by a previous call to
\fBXmClipboardStartCopy\fP\&.
.IP "\fIformat_name\fP" 10
Specifies the name of the format in which the data item
is stored on the clipboard\&. The format was known as target in the ICCCM\&.
.IP "\fIbuffer\fP" 10
Specifies the buffer from which the clipboard copies the data\&.
.IP "\fIlength\fP" 10
Specifies the
length, in bytes,
of the data being copied to the clipboard\&.
.IP "\fIprivate_id\fP" 10
Specifies the private data that the application wants
to store with the data item\&.
.IP "\fIdata_id\fP" 10
Specifies an identifying number assigned to the data item that uniquely
identifies the data item and the format\&.
This argument is required only for data that is passed by name\&.
.SH "RETURN"
.IP "\fBXmClipboardSuccess\fP" 10
The function was successful\&.
.IP "\fBXmClipboardLocked\fP" 10
The function failed because the clipboard was locked by another
application\&. The application can continue to call the function again with
the same parameters until the lock goes away\&. This gives the application
the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep trying or to give up
on the operation\&.
.IP "\fBXmClipboardFail\fP" 10
The function failed because \fBXmClipboardStartCopy\fP was not called or
because the data item contains too many formats\&.
.SH "RELATED"
