\fBXmList\fP \(em The List widget class
.iX "XmList"
.iX "widget class" "List"
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.nf
#include <Xm/List\&.h>
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
List allows a user to select one or more items
from a group of choices\&. Items are selected from the list in a
variety of ways, using both the pointer and the keyboard\&.
List operates on an array of compound strings that are defined by the application\&.
Each compound string becomes an item in the List,
with the first compound string becoming
the item in position 1, the second becoming the item in position 2, and so on\&.
.PP
Specifying the number of items that are visible
sets the size of the List\&.
If the number of visible items is not specified, the height
of the list controls the number of visible items\&. Each item assumes
the height of the tallest element in the list\&.
To create a list that allows the user to scroll easily through a large
number of items, use the \fBXmCreateScrolledList\fP convenience
function\&.
.PP
To select items, move the pointer or cursor to the desired item and
press the \fB<Btn1>\fP mouse button or the key defined as
\fB<osfSelect>\fP\&. There are several styles of selection behavior, and
they all highlight the selected item or items by displaying them in
inverse colors\&. An appropriate callback is invoked to notify the
application of the user\&'s choice\&. The application then takes whatever
action is required for the specified selection\&.
When a List is insensitive, all of the list items are displayed in a
stippled fill pattern\&.
.PP
List uses the \fBXmQTspecifyRenderTable\fP, \fBXmQTscrollFrame\fP, and
\fBXmQTnavigator\fP traits, and
holds the \fBXmQTtransfer\fP trait\&.
.SS "Selection"
.PP
Each list has one of four selection models:
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Single Select
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Browse Select
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Multiple Select
.IP "   \(bu" 6
Extended Select
.PP
In Single Select and Browse Select, at most one item is selected at a
time\&.
In Single Select, pressing \fB<Btn1>\fP on an item toggles its
selection state and deselects any other selected item\&.
In Browse Select, pressing \fB<Btn1>\fP on an item selects it and
deselects any other selected item; dragging \fB<Btn1>\fP moves the
selection as the pointer is moved\&. Releasing \fB<Btn1>\fP on an
item moves the location cursor to that item\&.
.PP
In Multiple Select, any number of items can be selected at a time\&.
Pressing \fB<Btn1>\fP on an item toggles its selection state but
does not deselect any other selected items\&.
.PP
In Extended Select, any number of items can be selected at a time,
and the user can easily select ranges of items\&.
Pressing \fB<Btn1>\fP on an item selects it and deselects any other
selected item\&.
Dragging \fB<Btn1>\fP or pressing or dragging \fB<Shift>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP following a
\fB<Btn1>\fP action selects all items between the item under the
pointer and the item on which \fB<Btn1>\fP was pressed\&.
This action also deselects any other selected items outside that
range\&.
.PP
Extended Select also allows the user to select and deselect
discontiguous ranges of items\&.
Pressing \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP on an item toggles its selection state but
does not deselect any other selected items\&.
Dragging \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP or pressing or dragging \fB<Shift>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP following a
\fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP action sets the selection state of all items between
the item under the pointer and the item on which \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP was
pressed to the state of the item on which \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP was pressed\&.
This action does not deselect any other selected items outside that
range\&.
.PP
All selection operations available from the mouse are also available
from the keyboard\&.
List has two keyboard selection modes, Normal Mode and Add Mode\&.
In Normal Mode, navigation operations and \fB<osfSelect>\fP select the
item at the location cursor and deselect any other selected
items\&.
In Add Mode, navigation operations have no effect on selection, and
\fB<osfSelect>\fP toggles the selection state of the item at the location
cursor without deselecting any other selected items, except in Single
Select\&.
.PP
Single and Multiple Select use Add Mode, and Browse Select uses Normal
Mode\&.
.PP
Extended Select can use either mode; the user changes modes by pressing
\fB<osfAddMode>\fP\&.
In Extended Select Normal Mode, pressing \fB<osfSelect>\fP has the same
effect as pressing \fB<Btn1>\fP; \fB<osfExtend>\fP and shifted navigation
have the same effect as pressing \fB<Shift>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP following a \fB<Btn1>\fP
action\&.
In Extended Select Add Mode, pressing \fB<osfSelect>\fP has the same
effect as pressing \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP; \fB<osfExtend>\fP and shifted navigation
have the same effect as pressing \fB<Shift>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP following a \fB<Ctrl>\fP\fB<Btn1>\fP
action\&.
.PP
Normal Mode is indicated by a solid location cursor, and Add Mode is
indicated by a dashed location cursor\&.
.SS "Data Transfer Behavior"
.PP
List supports dragging of items from the List and transfer of items to
the clipboard\&.
When the user presses \fBBTransfer\fP on a selected item, the widget
transfers all selected items\&.
When the user presses \fBBTransfer\fP on an unselected item, the widget
transfers only that item\&.
Depending on the value of \fBXmNprimaryOwnership\fP, List can also
support primary selection\&.
.PP
When the \fBXmNconvertCallback\fP procedures are called, the
\fBlocation_data\fP member of the \fBXmConvertCallbackStruct\fR member
is NULL if the selected items are being transferred\&.
If the selected items are not being transferred, this member has the
following value:
If a single item is being transferred, the value is an integer
representing the position of the item in the List\&.
A value of 1 transfers the first item in the List; a value of 2
transfers the second item; and so on\&.
If the entire contents of the List are being transferred, the value is
-1\&.
.PP
As a source of data, List supports the following targets and associated
conversions of data to these targets:
.IP "\fIlocale\fP" 10
If the \fIlocale\fP target matches the widget\&'s locale, the widget
transfers the selected list items in the encoding of the locale\&.
Each item transferred except the last includes a trailing separator\&.
.IP "\fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP" 10
The widget transfers the selected list items as type
\fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP\&.
Each item transferred except the last includes a trailing separator\&.
.IP "\fBSTRING\fP" 10
The widget transfers the selected list items as type \fBSTRING\fP\&.
Each item transferred except the last includes a trailing separator\&.
.IP "\fBTEXT\fP" 10
If the selected list items are fully convertible to the encoding of the
locale, the widget transfers the selected list items in the encoding of
the locale\&.
Otherwise, the widget transfers the selected list items as type
\fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP\&.
Each item transferred except the last includes a trailing separator\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS\fP" 10
The widget transfers, as type \fBATOM\fP, a list of the targets it
supports for immediate transfer for the \fBCLIPBOARD\fP selection\&.
These include \fB_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING\fP\&.
If the selected list items are fully convertible to \fBSTRING\fP, these
also include \fBSTRING\fP; otherwise, they also include
\fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING\fP" 10
The widget transfers the selected list items as a compound string in
Byte Stream format\&.
Each item transferred except the last includes a trailing separator\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS\fP" 10
The widget transfers, as type \fBATOM\fP, a list of the targets it
supports for delayed transfer for the \fBCLIPBOARD\fP selection\&.
This widget currently supplies no targets for
\fB_MOTIF_DEFERRED_CLIPBOARD_TARGETS\fP\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_EXPORT_TARGETS\fP" 10
The widget transfers, as type \fBATOM\fP, a list of the targets to be
used as the value of the DragContext\&'s \fBXmNexportTargets\fP in a
drag-and-drop transfer\&.
These include \fB_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING\fP, \fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP, the
encoding of the locale, \fBSTRING\fP, \fBTEXT\fP, \fBBACKGROUND\fP, and
\fBFOREGROUND\fP\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_LOSE_SELECTION\fP" 10
When the widget loses the selection, it deselects all list items\&.
.PP
As a source of data, List also supports the following standard Motif
targets:
.IP "\fBBACKGROUND\fP" 10
The widget transfers \fBXmNbackground\fP as type \fBPIXEL\fP\&.
.IP "\fBCLASS\fP" 10
The widget finds the first shell in the widget hierarchy that has a
\fBWM_CLASS\fP property and transfers the contents as text in the
current locale\&.
.IP "\fBCLIENT_WINDOW\fP" 10
The widget finds the first shell in the widget hierarchy and transfers
its window as type \fBWINDOW\fP\&.
.IP "\fBCOLORMAP\fP" 10
The widget transfers \fBXmNcolormap\fP as type \fBCOLORMAP\fP\&.
.IP "\fBFOREGROUND\fP" 10
The widget transfers \fBXmNforeground\fP as type \fBPIXEL\fP\&.
.IP "\fBNAME\fP" 10
The widget finds the first shell in the widget hierarchy that has a
\fBWM_NAME\fP property and transfers the contents as text in the current
locale\&.
.IP "\fBTARGETS\fP" 10
The widget transfers, as type \fBATOM\fP, a list of the targets it
supports\&.
These include the standard targets in this list\&.
These also include \fB_MOTIF_COMPOUND_STRING\fP, \fBCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP,
the encoding of the locale, \fBSTRING\fP, and \fBTEXT\fP\&.
.IP "\fBTIMESTAMP\fP" 10
The widget transfers the timestamp used to acquire the selection as type
\fBINTEGER\fP\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_RENDER_TABLE\fP" 10
The widget transfers \fBXmNrenderTable\fP if it exists, or else the
default text render table, as type \fBSTRING\fP\&.
.IP "\fB_MOTIF_ENCODING_REGISTRY\fP" 10
The widget transfers its encoding registry as type \fBSTRING\fP\&.
The value is a list of NULL separated items in the
form of tag encoding pairs\&.
This target symbolizes the transfer target for the
Motif Segment Encoding Registry\&.
Widgets and applications can use this Registry to register
text encoding formats for specified render table tags\&.
Applications access this Registry by calling
\fBXmRegisterSegmentEncoding\fP and \fBXmMapSegmentEncoding\fP\&.
.PP
List has no widget class destination procedure\&.
Subclasses and the \fBXmNdestinationCallback\fP procedures are
responsible for any data transfers to the widget\&.
.SS "Classes"
.PP
List inherits behavior, resources, and traits from \fBCore\fP and
\fBXmPrimitive\fP\&.
.PP
The class pointer is \fBxmListWidgetClass\fP\&.
.PP
The class name is \fBXmList\fP\&.
.SS "New Resources"
.PP
The following table defines a set of widget resources used by the programmer
to specify data\&. The programmer can also set the resource values for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget\&. To reference a
resource by name or by class in a \fB\&.Xdefaults\fP file, remove the \fBXmN\fP or
\fBXmC\fP prefix and use the remaining letters\&. To specify one of the defined
values for a resource in a \fB\&.Xdefaults\fP file,
remove the \fBXm\fP prefix and use
the remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but include any
underscores between words)\&.
The codes in the access column indicate if the given resource can be
set at creation time (C),
set by using \fBXtSetValues\fP (S),
retrieved by using \fBXtGetValues\fP (G), or is not applicable (N/A)\&.

.TE
.IP "\fBXmNautomaticSelection\fP" 10
Invokes either
\fBXmNbrowseSelectionCallback\fP or \fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP when
\fB<Btn1>\fP is pressed and the items that are shown as selected change
if the value is True (or \fBXmAUTO\fP) and the selection
mode is either \fBXmBROWSE_SELECT\fP or \fBXmEXTENDED_SELECT\fP respectively\&.
If False (\fBXmNO_AUTO_SELECT\fP), no selection callbacks are invoked until
the user releases the mouse button\&.
See \fBBehavior\fP for
further details on the interaction of this resource with the selection modes\&.
.IP "\fBXmNbrowseSelectionCallback\fP" 10
Specifies a list of callbacks that is called
when an item is selected in the browse selection mode\&. The reason is
\fBXmCR_BROWSE_SELECT\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNdefaultActionCallback\fP" 10
Specifies a list of callbacks that is called when an item is double
clicked or \fB<osfActivate>\fP is pressed\&.
The reason is \fBXmCR_DEFAULT_ACTION\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNdestinationCallback\fP" 10
Specifies a list of callbacks called when the List is the destination of
a transfer operation\&.
The type of the structure whose address is passed to these callbacks is
\fBXmDestinationCallbackStruct\fR\&.
The reason is \fBXmCR_OK\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNdoubleClickInterval\fP" 10
If a button click is followed by another button click within the time
span specified by this resource (in milliseconds), the button clicks
are considered a double-click action, rather than two single-click
actions\&.
The value must not be negative\&.
The default value is the display\&'s multiclick time\&.
.IP "\fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP" 10
Specifies a list of callbacks that is called
when items are selected using the extended selection mode\&.
The reason is \fBXmCR_EXTENDED_SELECT\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNfontList\fP" 10
Specifies the font list associated with the list items\&.
\fBXmNfontList\fP is obsolete and exists only for compatibility with
previous releases\&. You should now use \fBXmNrenderTable\fP instead of
\fBXmNfontList\fP\&. If both are specified, the render table will take
precedence\&. The font list is used in conjunction with the
\fBXmNvisibleItemCount\fP
resource to determine the height of the List widget\&.
If this
value is NULL at initialization, the parent hierarchy of the widget is
searched for a widget that
holds the \fBXmQTspecifyRenderTable\fP trait\&.
If such an ancestor is found, the font list is initialized to the
\fBXmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE\fP value of the ancestor widget\&. If no such widget
is found, the default is implementation dependent\&. Refer to
\fBXmFontList\fP(3) for more information on a font list structure\&.
.IP "\fBXmNitemCount\fP" 10
Specifies the total number of items\&.
The value must be the number of items in \fBXmNitems\fP and must not be
negative\&.
It is automatically updated by the list whenever an item is added to or
deleted from the list\&.
.IP "\fBXmNitems\fP" 10
Points to an array of compound strings that are to be displayed as the list
items\&.
Refer to \fBXmString\fP(3) for more information on the creation and
structure of compound strings\&.
\fBXtGetValues\fP for this resource returns the list items themselves,
not a copy of the list items\&.
The application must not free the returned items\&.
.IP "\fBXmNlistMarginHeight\fP" 10
Specifies the height of the margin between the list border and the items\&.
.IP "\fBXmNlistMarginWidth\fP" 10
Specifies the width of the margin between the list border and the items\&.
.IP "\fBXmNlistSizePolicy\fP" 10
Controls the reaction of the List when an item grows horizontally beyond
the current size of the list work area\&.
If the value is \fBXmCONSTANT\fP, the list viewing area does not grow,
and a horizontal ScrollBar is added for a List whose parent is a ScrolledWindow\&.
If this resource is set to \fBXmVARIABLE\fP, the List grows to
match the
size of the longest item, and no horizontal ScrollBar appears\&.
.IP "" 10
When the value of this resource is \fBXmRESIZE_IF_POSSIBLE\fP, the List
attempts to grow or shrink to match the width of the widest item\&.
If it cannot grow to match the widest size, a horizontal ScrollBar is
added for a List whose parent is a ScrolledWindow
if the longest item is wider than the list
viewing area\&.
.IP "" 10
The size policy must be set at the time the List widget is created\&.
It cannot be changed at a later time through \fBXtSetValues\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNlistSpacing\fP" 10
Specifies the spacing between list items\&.
This spacing increases by the value of the \fBXmNhighlightThickness\fP
resource in Primitive\&.
.IP "\fBXmNmatchBehavior\fP" 10
Specifies the matching behavior followed by XmList\&.
The current values are \fBXmNONE\fP and \fBXmQUICK_NAVIGATE\fP, as follows:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmNONE\fP" 10
Specifies that the typed in characters are ignored\&.
.IP "\fBXmQUICK_NAVIGATE\fP" 10
Specifies that 1-character navigation shall be supported when List
has focus\&. If the typed character is
the initial character of some set of items in
List, the first of those items following the current
item will be navigated to (become the current
item)\&. If all such items precede the current item, the
first such item becomes the current item\&.
Subsequently, typing the same character will
cyclically navigate among the items with the same first
character\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBXmNmultipleSelectionCallback\fP" 10
Specifies a list of callbacks that is called
when an item is selected in
multiple selection mode\&. The reason is \fBXmCR_MULTIPLE_SELECT\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNprimaryOwnership\fP" 10
Specifies whether XmContainer takes ownership of the Primary selection
when a selection is made inside it\&. This resource can take the
following values:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmOWN_NEVER\fP" 10
Never takes ownership\&.
.IP "\fBXmOWN_ALWAYS\fP" 10
Always takes ownership\&.
.IP "\fBXmOWN_MULTIPLE\fP" 10
Only takes ownership is more than one element has been selected\&.
.IP "\fBXmOWN_POSSIBLE_MULTIPLE\fP" 10
Only takes ownership if more than one element can be selected at a
time\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBXmNrenderTable\fP" 10
Specifies the render table associated with the list items\&. The render
table is used in conjunction with the
\fBXmNvisibleItemCount\fP
resource to determine the height of the List widget\&. If this
value is NULL at initialization, List searches its parent hierarchy
for a widget that
holds the \fBXmQTspecifyRenderTable\fP trait\&.
If such an ancestor is found, the render table is initialized to the
\fBXmTEXT_RENDER_TABLE\fP value of the ancestor widget\&. If no such widget
is found, the default is implementation dependent\&. If a font list and
a render table are both specified, the
render table will take precedence\&. Refer to
\fBXmRenderTable\fP(3) for more information on the creation and
structure of a render table\&.
.IP "\fBXmNscrollBarDisplayPolicy\fP" 10
Controls the display of vertical ScrollBars in a
List whose parent is a ScrolledWindow\&.
When the value of this resource is \fBXmAS_NEEDED\fP, a vertical
ScrollBar is displayed only when the number of items in the List exceeds
the number of visible items\&.
When the value is \fBXmSTATIC\fP, a vertical ScrollBar is always
displayed\&.
.IP "\fBXmNselectColor\fP" 10
Allows the application to specify the color of the background rectangle
that indicates selected text\&. It takes two values:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmDEFAULT_SELECT_COLOR\fP" 10
Causes the select color to be set to a color
between the background and the bottom shadow color\&.
.IP "\fBXmREVERSED_GROUND_COLORS\fP" 10
Forces the select color to the
foreground color and the color of any text rendered over the
select color to be in the background color\&.
.IP "\fBHIGHLIGHT_COLOR\fP" 10
Forces the fill color to use the highlight color\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBXmNselectedItemCount\fP" 10
Specifies the number of strings in the selected items list\&.
The value must be the number of items in \fBXmNselectedItems\fP and must
not be negative\&.
.IP "\fBXmNselectedItems\fP" 10
Points to an array of compound strings that represents the list items that
are currently selected, either by the user or by the application\&.
\fBXtGetValues\fP for this resource returns the list items themselves,
not a copy of the list items\&.
The application must not free the returned items or the array\&.
.IP "" 10
Setting \fBXmNselectedItems\fP selects those list items that exactly
match items in the given \fBXmNselectedItems\fP list\&. There may be
additional items in \fBXmNselectedItems\fP that do not match items in
the list\&. These items remain until \fBXmNselectedItems\fP is updated\&.
If \fBXmNitems\fP is changed such that the list now contains items
matching previously unmatched items in \fBXmNselectedItems\fP, those
new items will also appear selected\&.
.IP "" 10
Any user interaction with the list that causes at least one item to be
selected or deselected and any call to
\fBXmListDeleteAllItems\fP,

updated immediately to exactly reflect the visual state of the list\&.
Calls to any other \fBXmList\fP functions do not affect
\fBXmNselectedItems\fP\&.
.IP "\fBXmNselectedPositionCount\fP" 10
Specifies the number of positions in the selected positions list\&.
The value must be the number of items in \fBXmNselectedPositions\fP
.IP "\fBXmNselectedPositions\fP" 10
Points to an array of the positions of the selected items in the List\&.
\fBXtGetValues\fP for this resource returns the
list items themselves, not a copy of the list
items\&. The application must not free the returned
items or the array\&.
.IP "\fBXmNselectionMode\fP" 10
Defines what effect keyboard navigations have on selection\&. The valid
modes are:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmADD_MODE\fP" 10
Allows no navigation operations to have effect on selection, and
\fB<osfSelect>\fP toggles the selection state of the item at the location
cursor without deselecting any other selected items, except in Single
Select\&. However, the widget cannot be put into add mode if the

.SS "Callback Information"
.PP
List defines a new callback structure\&. The application must first look at the
reason field and use only the structure members that are valid for that
particular reason, because not all fields are relevant for
every possible reason\&. The callback structure is defined as follows:
.PP
.nf
typedef struct

        unsigned char \fIauto_selection_type\fP;
} XmListCallbackStruct;
.fi
.IP "\fIreason\fP" 10
Indicates why the callback was invoked\&.
.IP "\fIevent\fP" 10
Points to the \fBXEvent\fP that triggered the callback\&. It can be NULL\&.
.IP "\fIitem\fP" 10
The last item selected at the time of the \fIevent\fP that caused the
callback\&.
\fIitem\fP points to a temporary storage space that is reused after the
callback is finished\&.
Therefore, if an application needs to save the item, it should copy the
item into its own data space\&.
.IP "\fIitem_length\fP" 10
The length in bytes of \fIitem\fP\&.
This member is obsolete and exists for compatibility with
earlier releases\&.
.IP "\fIitem_position\fP" 10
The position (plus one) of \fIitem\fP in the List\&'s \fBXmNitems\fP array\&.
An \fIitem_position\fP value of one symbolizes the first element in the
list\&.
.IP "\fIselected_items\fP" 10
A list of items selected at the time of the \fIevent\fP that caused
the callback\&.
\fIselected_items\fP points to a temporary storage space that is reused
after the callback is finished\&.
Therefore, if an application needs to save the selected list, it should
copy the list into its own data space\&.
.IP "\fIselected_item_count\fP" 10
The number of items in the \fIselected_items\fP list\&.
This number must be non-negative\&.
.IP "\fIselected_item_positions\fP" 10
An array of integers, one for each selected item, representing the
position of each selected item in the List\&'s \fBXmNitems\fP array\&.
\fIselected_item_positions\fP points to a temporary storage space that
is reused after the callback is finished\&.
Therefore, if an application needs to save this array, it should copy
the array into its own data space\&.
.IP "\fIselection_type\fP" 10
Indicates that the most recent extended selection was the initial
selection (\fBXmINITIAL\fP), a modification of an existing selection
(\fBXmMODIFICATION\fP), or an additional noncontiguous selection
(\fBXmADDITION\fP)\&.
.IP "\fBauto_selection_type\fP" 10
Indicates the type of automatic selection callback\&. The types of
callbacks include the following:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmAUTO_BEGIN\fP" 10
Indicates the beginning of automatic selection\&.
.IP "\fBXmAUTO_MOTION\fP" 10
Indicates that there is a button drag selection\&.
.IP "\fBXmAUTO_CANCEL\fP" 10
Indicates that the new selection is cancelled\&.
.IP "\fBXmAUTO_NO_CHANGE\fP" 10
Indicates that the currently selected item matches the initial item\&.
.IP "\fBXmAUTO_CHANGE\fP" 10
Indicates that the currently selected item does not match the initial item\&.

.IP "\fIreason\fP" 10
Indicates why the callback was invoked\&.
.IP "\fIevent\fP" 10
Points to the \fBXEvent\fP that triggered the callback\&.
It can be NULL\&.
.IP "\fIselection\fP" 10
Indicates the selection for which data transfer is being requested\&.
Possible values are \fBCLIPBOARD\fP, \fBPRIMARY\fP, \fBSECONDARY\fP, and
\fB_MOTIF_DROP\fP\&.
.IP "\fIoperation\fP" 10
Indicates the type of transfer operation requested\&.
.RS
.IP "   \(bu" 6
When the selection is \fBPRIMARY\fP, possible values are \fBXmMOVE\fP,
\fBXmCOPY\fP, and \fBXmLINK\fP\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
When the selection is \fBSECONDARY\fP or \fBCLIPBOARD\fP, possible
values are \fBXmCOPY\fP and \fBXmLINK\fP\&.
.IP "   \(bu" 6
When the selection is \fB_MOTIF_DROP\fP, possible values are
\fBXmMOVE\fP, \fBXmCOPY\fP, \fBXmLINK\fP, and \fBXmOTHER\fP\&.
A value of \fBXmOTHER\fP means that the callback procedure must get
further information from the \fBXmDropProcCallbackStruct\fR in the
\fIdestination_data\fP member\&.
.RE
.IP "\fIflags\fP" 10
Indicates whether or not the destination widget is also the source of
the data to be transferred\&.
Following are the possible values:
.RS
.IP "\fBXmCONVERTING_NONE\fP" 10
The destination widget is not the source of the data to be transferred\&.
.IP "\fBXmCONVERTING_SAME\fP" 10
The destination widget is the source of the data to be transferred\&.
.RE
.IP "\fBtransfer_id\fP" 10
Serves as a unique ID to identify the transfer transaction\&.
.IP "\fIdestination_data\fP" 10
Contains information about the destination\&.
When the selection is \fB_MOTIF_DROP\fP, the callback procedures are
called by the drop site\&'s \fBXmNdropProc\fP, and \fIdestination_data\fP
is a pointer to the \fBXmDropProcCallbackStruct\fR passed to the
\fBXmNdropProc\fP procedure\&.
When the selection is \fBSECONDARY\fP, \fIdestination_data\fP is an Atom
representing a target recommmended by the selection owner for use in
converting the selection\&.
Otherwise, \fIdestination_data\fP is NULL\&.
.IP "\fBlocation_data\fP" 10
Contains information about the location where data is to be transferred\&.
The value is always NULL when the selection is \fBSECONDARY\fP or
\fBCLIPBOARD\fP\&.
If the value is NULL, the data is to be inserted at the widget\&'s cursor
position\&.
Otherwise, the value is an integer representing the position in the List
where the items are to be transferred\&.
A value of 1 makes the first new item the first item in the list; a
value of 2 makes it the second item; and so on\&.
Once \fBXmTransferDone\fP procedures start to be called,
\fBlocation_data\fP will no longer be stable\&.
.IP "\fItime\fP" 10
Indicates the time when the transfer operation began\&.
.SS "Translations"

\fBXmList\fP includes translations from Primitive\&.
The \fBXmList\fP translations are described in the following list\&.

.IP "ListAddMode():" 10
Toggles the state of Add Mode for keyboard selection\&.
.IP "ListBeginData():" 10
Moves the location cursor to the first item in the list\&.
In Normal Mode, this also deselects any current selection,
selects the first item in the list, and calls the appropriate selection
callbacks (\fBXmNbrowseSelectionCallback\fP when
\fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmBROWSE_SELECT\fP,
\fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP when \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set

this action moves the location cursor to the first item in the list\&.
.IP "" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmEXTENDED_SELECT\fP,
this action does the following:
If an extended selection has been made from the current anchor point,
restores the selection state of the items in that range to their state
before the extended selection was done;
changes the selection state of the first item and all
items between it and the current anchor point to the state of the
item at the current anchor point;
calls the \fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP callbacks\&.
.IP "ListBeginExtend():" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmEXTENDED_SELECT\fP,
this action does the following:
If an extended selection has been made from the current anchor point,
restores the selection state of the items in that range to their state
before the extended selection was done, and
changes the selection state of the item under the pointer and all
items between it and the current anchor point to the state of the
item at the current anchor point\&.
If \fBXmNautomaticSelection\fP is set to True, this action calls the
\fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP callbacks\&.
The \fBauto_selection_type\fP component of the callback structure will
be set to \fBXmAUTO_BEGIN\fP\&.
.IP "ListBeginLine():" 10
Moves the horizontal scroll region to the beginning of the line\&.
.IP "ListBeginSelect():" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmSINGLE_SELECT\fP,
deselects any current selection and toggles the selection state of the
item under the pointer\&.
.IP "" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmBROWSE_SELECT\fP,
deselects any current selection and selects the item under the pointer\&.

Any previous selections remain\&.
.IP "" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmEXTENDED_SELECT\fP,
this action deselects any current selection,
selects the item under the pointer, and
sets the current anchor at that item\&.
If \fBXmNautomaticSelection\fP is set to True,
this action calls the
\fBXmNextendedSelectionCallback\fP callbacks\&.
The \fBauto_selection_type\fP component of the callback structure will
be set to \fBXmAUTO_BEGIN\fP\&.
.IP "ListBeginToggle():" 10
If \fBXmNselectionPolicy\fP is set to \fBXmEXTENDED_SELECT\fP,
this action moves the current anchor to the item under the pointer
without changing the current selection\&.
